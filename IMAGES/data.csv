review
"The library should be the strength of a university. It is awesome that we have this perfectly. we can really learn practically. However, we lack open space and also a relaxing place also."
"University Is About Knowledge & Library Is he Primary Source Of Knwoledge. Library is very important for any university.  Moreover, our clubs need more attention and facilities."
"course content of the university is good . that is important because without proper course content, there is no meaning of studying courses by paying so much money. I can just study in youtube."
Got admitted due to Family opinion. all in short time so lengthy syllabus very helpful excessive tuition fees be a good human being also a good engineer.
The bond between versities are never found in Bangladesh. We can see syllabus changes almost in every versity. if we talk about the public vs private the concept and circular are quite different but if the contents are same then it will help the students  i guess The educational quality of the versity is quite good but the student taking tendency is a great matter of concern.the way versity is taking students its becoming hard to maintain schedule and teachers are becoming tired as well cannot provide equal attention towards student.
Universiy facilities not good enough. we want something more. WE need good labs and equipments. We need people who can motivate us to be more creative.
"TARC experience was awesome as an university thing.It taught me so many things and most importantly , gave me a chance to see my limits."
"University teachers are pretty interactive, But it all depends on the student to gain as much as knowledge he can from the teacher. Teachers are punctual and very helpful during exams time."
yeah Quite well library in university but some of the books are not available. the university needs to provide a place to eat .
It is very good learning in this university. expecting more knowledge. we expecct more motivation and performances.
Private & Public Universities must have good material in labs. But our country only cares about money and saving it.
"Class and quality, No campus, open credit system, Management, Friendly campus, Used to be great now average"
"there are lot of extracurricular activites held in university but so many of them are unknown to us ,the problem is there is no such ad's viewed to us. my rating is 3/5"
"The teachers of the university is fully knowledgeable. This is crucial for any university. however, we do lack space and campus."
"IT IS GOING GOOD in this university, experience with friends. friends are really what matters to me"
I chose CSE department as I want to study engineering. Because of its facilities and achievement. This university do not have a proper campus .The academic facilities it provides to the students. The campus of this university .My expectations from this university is to have a proper campus and to improve its transport services.  
"BRAC UNIVERSITY EEE, Because my mother wanted EEE,  Only tarc apart from that nothing.Tarc. Everything from campus to the dept. Teachers leaving for masters every semester and many more issues. A good dept. with proper educational support from the faculties and the register office. "
"Education quality is good but the system is bad.Again, quality good but system is not satisfying "
"BBS because BBA is my University Subject, The good thing includes achievements and facilities. Poor campus. Strong course structure. "
"excellent university, the mode of teaching is completely different than any other university. lecturers are very friendly with every one they interact just like friends and they are very punctual"
TEACHING QUALITY IS VERY HIGH BUT NEED TO TAKE DOWN SOME ACTIVITIES . NOISE POLLITION IN THE UNIVERSITY ALWAYS A BIG PROBLEM.
University must be serious about the student's success. Our university is more focused on admitting students but not in how what they're receiving it.
Teachers are doing their job well in the university. Our teachers are giving us time to make us understand our topics.
"I wanted to be a developer. Reputation, Lack of campus. Out of date curriculum. Recent drives to modernize Slow administration. Horrible IT support. Student first policies. Not satisfied yet."
More number of lab/practicals should be there to enhance practical knowledge in the University
One of the best things I like about this university is it's facilities. The best of computers and technology is provided which makes us work well.
Univerity in bangladesh are not too bad. They have modern facilities but are nothing compared to foreign universities
Private university all are good in Bangladesh. They provide world standard syllabus.
Diversity in the university is the best. I'm satisfied With University Students. They're all friendly.
CSE Wanted As Subject. Lack Of Faculties & Skills. Space Problems In the university.
The Universy Must have NICE TIMING for both students & faculties
"My elder brother is a graduate from BRACU. And since I didn't get into a public university's desired department I opted for BRAC's CSE dept. Because I actually was interested to learn about how everything worked. Shortage of breathing space. Too many people. Open credited major system but people not getting their desired courses or times due to overpopulation. My friends. No space to have the proper university life. My expectation is nothing but, space.And no. It's not. Top notch teachers. Everyone looks out for the best of the students. Not really. "
"I like coding so CSE is my Subject. good things are achievements, faculties, alumnis, location.Campus is not up to the mark, hence, demotivating. The CSE department, the people in it. The staffs. And most people in general. Somehow, majority of them are friendly and kind.The Campus. Short time for each courses makes learning process very difficult.It sure is guiding me towards something. Expectations are limitless. Good"
everything is good for faculty but not for students in the university
Examination pattern is good but marks distribution very confusing. we also need value in the eye of the mass.
Too much lab file work in University. we need more practical knowledge but we also need balance in system.
Labs are upto the mark in the Private Universities. We also have freedom.
"I dont like University, too much pressure unnecessirily.we also need space in the job market"
The courses available in the university have got a scope and the teaching of these courses goes on with the point of view of bringing out the best from the student by indulging them in different activities and projects.
I guess for better opportunities in future Better education quality Campus of course and fees are higher Opportunity to learn Not getting enough practical knowledge or implementation of regular classesIt's kinda okay. 
"Brand Value, Quality Education It doesn't have a campus The teachers It doesn't have a campus Being recognized anywhere I go just by the name of my University. People will automatically know how my skills are depending on where I'm graduated from. I think my expectations will be satisfied, don't know yet.Teachers are the best assets of my University,We don't have a large campus so I'm disappointed with the facilities"
They should gradually start to follow the system of foreign universities to give us the best education My university has good students but what is missing is well equipped faculties in ebery department 
"BRAC UNIVERSITY Architecture. Because of building cool looking house models Architecture. Because of building cool looking house modelsFound Many people who shares same ideology Residential semester Too much buisness and commercial centric administration which in many ways heavily impacts the core point, the education itself.Got a degree. Im satisfied.Some good teachers and some awful. Poor facilities. Some good teachers and some awful. Poor facilities.  "
Achievements Less faculty members and university campus .Education Campus environment Good and friendly faculties that can create an friendly environment of teaching. I am not satisfied with the faculty of my  department. They’re great but EEE department’s faculty members are less in number.
Almost each and every books is there.But the time limit for keeping book is too much shorted.
"Computer Science. No campus, there is not enough place for students to sit and relax. Residential Semester. BRACU administration No expectations I just want to graduate and get out of hereNo all the teachers are good. Those who are good are too good and who are bad are way too bad"
sometimes proper course material is not required. the public have more standards than the private
Private university in bangladesh are very good indeed. They have more achievements than the public universities
"Achievements, Feed,pre advising, advising, Famous, High fees without facilities "
too many activities are conducted and student get ample amount of opportunities to participate
there are many courses which are irrelevant to the branch. some topics are not covered. There is no proper material for any course
it is difficult to understand experiment in 1 hour in the university. we also need value in the job market
"University with best campus is the best. Without a campus, a University has no value."
university management is extordinary but some of the faculty is very bad. also we dont have campus actually.
good enough if the Private Universities have a campus and value in the job market.
lab practical work help us to learn the things properly and evalution is also very necessary as it helps us to retain concepts
its booring. teachers need to be creative. we need more motivation . our labs need more technology and attention.
It is statisfactory beacuse teachers are very creative. we are getting new experiences
Well and Good only if the teachers are willing to help which doesn't happen actually.
"too many examination, we are frustrated with this university. we also need value in the job market"
I like it Reputation and standard No campus Curriculum and our chairperson and VC Campus issue
rough handling approach of the university is annoying. we need more time and pace.
University performance is Excellent in projects . the private have more achievements than the public in competitions.
Computer Science and Technology. I chose this department because computer science is the most potential sector of study now a days. And vastness of variety of sectors that depends on computer science attracted me. High Fees must be reduced. This institute doesn’t provide enough opportunities for co-curricular activities.  Closed credit. Helps to fulfil courses in time. And a very up to date syllabus. Sometimes teachers have very high expectations that pressurizes students. Mostly satisfied but yet there are some conditons to develop. I have mixed opinion here. Some are very talented and up to date with recent studies. And they are helpful. But some are boring and not quite up to date 
"teaching is ok but the interaction with the students need to improve, i mean they have to focus on dull students more than intelligents...."
"To learn about English language and literature For lower tuition fee-Transport system  is not available 
Wi-fi connection is not available in the Whole University .
Less number of books in the Library .
VC are not approved by UGC. but on the processing may be.
A case is filed against BOT member.
There is no permanent Campus..-Low cost.
Teachers are qualified and friendly .
Students are so friendly -conflict among BOT members.
Not giving attention to upgrad the University of the BOT members. 
We need 
Transport system .
permanent Campus.
High speed wi-fi connection .
approved VC.
Huge collection of books in the library -very friendly.
qualified.
sincere .
I think you will give the messages which I share to our authority and play important rule to improve the quality of our university  as well as the others university of our country "
"excellent simply superb. no ragging, women are free and there is so many modern lab facilities. i love it here in private far better than so called public"
when compared to other Private Universities we need better material and exposure in BRAC. our university only cares about money.
all activities are good. but htere is lack of quality education. anywaysn lots of stuff to do except studying and thats what i like most
Examination pattern and marks distribution all the terms are good.Ca and MTE also give the chance to students for improving. the campus must be improved though.
there should not be negative marking because many students are getting more than they deserve. i hate private university grading system
"English and Humanities because BRACU is one of the top Private Universities in BD..No campus, bad grading criteria. Nothing is better than our club facilities. Everything (mostly grading system)Not satisfied with rules outside the the university buildings"
library facilities are good but number of books are less. there should be more computers also since they are taking so many students. also the clubs should have more facilities.
satisfactory when it comes to education. horrible when it comes to campus. excellent when it comes to freedom.
its hard to find a computer working in lab. Students cannot save data in one single PC. there is lack of efficiency in the computer system of our university.
sport and recreation are not available. thats sad. there should be a reliable sports field for students . the public has more functionality than the private
"exam pattern is good, very well marks distribution and paper checking varies from faculty to faculty. the private have more achievements"
"CSE because its the Best private university in Bangladesh for studying .transportation problem: University bus is too early or too late for students like me who lives in narayangonj 
time schedule :I have to start for university at 6:30 for class at 9:30 and my class schedule is like 9:30-10:50 , 12:30-1:50,3:30-4:50 so I have to stay outside from 6:30 am to 9:00 pm
so I don't get enough time to study at home. teachers are friendly it doesn't have a campusI learnt new things here and I am working harder these days than before. they are really helpful and friendly.please help the students who are facing problems in the university"
"it is not very deep when itn comes to knowledge, but we get a quick semester and this motivates me to study. it's not too boring. we can graduate quickly."
"I think stock is not enough, more books are required. We need assistants in the lab so that they can coperate. we need sports facilities. we really need a campus actually."
"Not upto the mark when it comes to handling the students. need more resources, need to provide courses properly. it is awesome that there are so many types of food to eat everyday outside the campus."
"Excellent but it depends upon teacher. as a teacher of public , i can testify that private universities can be a great source of inoovation and revolution of education in bangladesh."
Private university's lab is very much helpful than public. private unoversities really seek excellence.
course material is perfect but we need fixed credit system. there are students studying for 10 years
"Following the trend Fame . No place for students. Only classroom available. 
Not enough  resource for learn new things. Some good Faculties Open Credit is the most amazing thing about university."
increasing confidence among students by giving proper grades. the semester is quick and we get results very quickly.
syllabus is more which required time ..it should b less so that student can proper concentrate getting the knowlegde instead of just covering the syllabus
"i dont know about public but if only we had campus, I think we are perfect already. the private have more value than the public"
it is good learning these courses and getting practical experience. But we need a campus to breath probably.
"labs are interesting and helpful for the knowledge. however, the theory teachers are really boring even though they are qualified."
"how come there' scholarship for 3.7+. There should be scholarship for 3.0+. There is no internship, it's ridiculous."
Private university library facilities are not good.They are not following the rules( they are using phones in library).
Reading facilities are excellent.but only limited books are available .so books should be increased. there should be more ways of learning creativity.
Politics in the university is sick. There is also ragging. It's all sick here in public. the private have more freedom than the public
"Material of the course is not good enough to compete international realm. We need to seek beyond what we have and look forward to further development like Oxford, harvard and others."
Good marks distribution .Students can easily check there performance throught the semester and seek improvement which is really amazing.
"CSE due to Pressure from family. No real campus.  Wanted proper football playing field but the university doesn't really give any importance here. S for teachers, Some are nice. Some are not nice"
Practical and easy learning approaches. Loving the way they teach computer science. Not everyone can teach computer science easily amd make it understandable.
THEY IS NO PROBLEM WITH EDUCATION BUT THERE IS DEFINITELY PROBLEM WITH CAMPUS AND FACILITIES.
Universities are not focusing on education. They're rather focused on getting a higher rank and getting more money.
Electrical and Electronic Engineering Is Crucial For a University. Environment is horrible. No Session block is great. expected to graduate within the time period and i got it.They are too good and cooperative . teachers were cooperative
yeah its obviously good that you have a university where you can do as you please and you are safe. You are not a lab rat of the seniors.
All is good. no other university is so serious about the concept of practicals. It is very important tp gain practical knowledge instead of just seeking grades blindly.
"CGPA is not the only method of judgement Reputation Too many students.Business strategy No campus At least some courses should be offered based on the current demands. No, they are not met. Only the basics are taught Adequate The university really should stop admitting so many students in one subject"
some of the faculty are not uploading slides and thus we are not getting necessary materials. We have to do a lot of self study and that is not nice.
"BBA is good and professional. lot of opportunities to do internship , make creative decisions and to try our desired ields."
"English and Humanities, Cause BRACU is one of the top Private Universities in BD.No campus, bad grading criteria (mostly grading system) , Not satisfied with university rules, English faculties are nice bt very strict "
They are good beacuse there is freedom of students. In public universities you are the slave of elders but here you can be fee. This is really what it means to study.
The universities in bangladesh do not focus on creative learning they care about students moral value
Required text books are not available to every student. students are not getting their desired courses
"Very good indeed to be in a place where there is no politics, no ragging and women can move freely as they please."
"Computer science and engineering, It has demandIt's good and have facilities though the fees is very high. The fee is very very high.Some awsome faculties are there. campus is horrible. Don't know yet about students, Some are too good,and sone of them are average for me"
"The university is painful experience becau there aren't good opportunities for women, there should be some space. The conjusted lift and every place is conjusted. it's very upsetting."
"The material provided in this university is depth of course, The courses in this university is knowledgeable"
"Needs some improvement in edfucation, campus, facilites, faculties, quality. Yes, in everything"
"examination checking sucks here , don't knw why I get low marks even if 4 qustions are wrong . answer key of exam is absurd, discrepancy system is not advantageous, answers of exam not right, omr should be uploaded"
"English department BRAC made it's name among Universities and was one of the best Universities then and still is.Too much student enrolment and no campus of it's own.Prepares the students for the future.Only concentrates on institutional education. Certain study tours are important as well.The feel which an University should provide to it's students are done primarily through a campus. As of now there's no campus in BRAC.Very good.A University should also have hostels for the students. In the primary stage of a university student, it wastes much time to search for a place to live that too close to the University in Dhaka city. Which in many cases takes too much money for a middle class student's family. So, I think there should be hostels for the students."
"Capacity of library is less compared to size of university. The university lacks security , anyone can get in with a fake ID card"
In my opnion very less content is their in our syllabus..it will be good if there is more syllabus and depth included in our syllabus
exam pattern is very good but if you give question papers to students it is helpful. also there is issues with food. there should be a place for us to eat
I think the practicals should be of 2 hours. That's enough I think. Rest is fine. Also we should be rewarded with certificates
most of the teacher don't even bother about the practical performed by students.They give marks just by seeing face or something like that.
VERY NICE....BUT BOOKS ARE NOT AVAILABE EVERY TIME. also there is no transport system which should be a matter of concern
The semesters are awesome and quick. university has provide best teachers for us . very satisfied.
Horrible things in the university include the grading syste. There is no decency and smoking is like everywhere. At least provide a good space for us who just want to study
Education must be disseminated through action and everywhere. A graduate first learn to be humble and give accolades to the surrounding and environment
some of the faculties don't know how to behave otherwise it is good. we dont have good communication among teachers
"The materials or links provided for study purpose is good, clarity in depth of courses but again it differs from teacher to teacher."
library facilities need to be improve by bringing some more books . also there isn't a peaceful spot to stuy and think. people are making love everywhere.
The course notes are very knowledgeable and proper. But they really lack campus & security.
"Excellent exam pattern, paper checking in this university is easy. this keeps us motivated and wanna try to do better."
"EEEC ourse distribution is good, Qualified professors makes it the best, Over pressure in education, Satisfied except a few facts like excessive students. grading system of the private University should be changed"
"Private universities  need to stop thinking that they're best in education, They have enough money to improve and bring innovations."
The way of teaching is good but we will be recognized as a lower education class just because it was private. I'll be judged by my tag.
marks distribution is good but paper checking is not that well. But i feel we can study here with a fixed pattern and there is a fixed schedule for everything which is good.
Creative and writing facility is good. The teachers are professionals and they're smart. Really enjoy these professional creativity
"Exam pattern is up to the mark and the Cgpa depends on the various marks distributions like ca, mte etc which is very nice as compare to other institutions. Paper checking does not depend on length of ques but on the material which is the best part of it."
everything is good except the expenditures. They cost too much. They should at least consider scholarship for people with cgpa above 3.
"Great experience it was. I was upset with a small campus but in the end, what mattered was being able to graduate peacefully without delays unlike in public."
"CSE. I chose to study CSE because I was interested to learn about Computer Science.Fees and Facilities.Mainly there are problems i have regarding the Faculty issues. The campus is beautiful and people there are very nice and polite.The fact that departments don't let us know, before the semester begins, about which faculties we are being provided.I am expecting to see improvements regarding the faculty issues. Better effort in improving their way of teaching.most of them are polite, except for few."
I have never seen this type of examination in education.very GOOD pattern here in private universities
every thing is fine but there is oo much to spend on. They lack scholarships. the tuition fee is very high.
Descency is absent. People stare at us like we're something to eat.  I feel like I'm in a zoo. I believe private universities are not like this.
University in Bangladesh don't provide proper rights to women. There's lack of security & opportunities.
"the faculties are upto the mark, so are our subject ciricullum. Love this university even though private is neglected."
practical work is good in our labs. In public I've heard that they ignore. But our teachers are serious.
library facilites are good in public universities. Lots of books and variations. You can't expect these in a university of a single building
BBA  is Ongoing Demand Subject. Campus & Quality education . Huge number of students than the capacity. Quality of education and  quite satisfied. Performance Vary from person-to-person
BBA is the best SUBJECT. LACK OF CAMPUS AND STUDENT OVERFLOW. QUALITY RULES AND REGULATIONS Are Moderate.  A NEW CAMPUS is required.
BRAC UNIVERSITY CSE is the best. TARC was the best among all universities. Education System is Good. Not all of faculties were good 
Everything is fine. Every thing is taught in depth.Even a single point is elaborated enough to understand.
teaching activities of our university is good. i am satisfied with it. we need more performance in labs
"CSE dept. Basically I choose it because I thought it’s interesting AchievementsThere isn’t any campus. I was a student of English Dept. at first and their faculties are way too rude and unprofessional. Otherwise BRAC University’s main problem is the CAMPUS.Opportunities, scopes, Residential semester, Bonding, education level is high.Just the CAMPUS Fact. We badly need a campus. And need official Annual tours for students. It’s a 50/50 situation. I expect a CAMPUS from BRAC University and more field works and experiences.Some are really good and some are really bad. Evaluation should be a serious concern "
I am satisfied with the facilities but few books are limited of database distribution
Lab is good the Prof explains everything before the lab begins and the Lab Asst helps us during the experiments
"cse because of its versatility subject, campus is too small , lack of scholarships, campus size, good academic and social support. "
"It doesn’t matter to which university fate takes you, you have to be hardworking and persistent."
Educational quality should be increased. There is Lack of study environment
Private universities are better than public but they're just homeless. Also the private have more achievements than the public.
"More scopes has to be there in private universities. Many subjects missing, syllabus missing, freedom missing and more"
punctuality and lecture is good in  private universities even though it's on a small room but interaction isn't good.
teaching is good some lecturers are showing partiality between south people and north people
"Exam pattern Very good, Marks distribution good but sometimes disappointing, paper checking OK"
Private universities are undoubtedly very strict and that's why there is always success.
"pUBLIC UNIVERSITIES are showing partiality between THE RICH AND THE POOR , THE GOOD AND THE BAD."
IN MY OPINION PRIVATEUNIVERSITIES ARE GOOD. THEY HAVE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE BUT THEY FOCUS ON MONEY RATHER THAN IMPROVEMENT.
libary is giving a lot to us but we are not getting it. We need more practical experience and unfortunately these are missing in private universities.
for some subjects like maths and english(passage writing) the time duration neds to increase
examination pattern in private universities are excellent. There is competition. the private have more success than the public
"Library, campus and standards of public universities are always over the top then any private university"
CSE is the future and CSE is amazing in this university. It motivates us to enter contests and so they're awesome
Private universities helps in improving skills. Theyforce us to be creative and make changes in our patterns.
the content of the course should be optimum. Private universities have optimum content but public are only focused on politics
"CSE.BECAUSE EVERYONE IS DOING IT. The girl I liked studied here so I got admitted too. Unfortunately she got a boyfriend just after I joined brac. There's No campus. The Good teachers Amke it amazing. Expectation is to get good jobs, "
"I chose CSE because I love to code.Facilities, Campus, Pre-advising are amazing things about this university. My expectations are having a campus, having great facilities, having friendly faculties. They are partially being satisfied.."
The examination system of the university is very impressive. The sitting plan of he students is made in such a way that no 2 students of same class give the exam in same room or even sometimes same blocks. Through this students also get to know and visit different blocks of the university.The checking is also fair .
Private universities are  quite great and unique. They are safer than public universities.
Subject & Campus is a huggeeeee problem. TARC was the best. The MNS courses are horrible. My expectation is to have a good career and i can tell the satisfaction after achieving it.
"In private universities they provide us with good lab faculities, which is very important as it gives us proper practical experience"
EEE is the Fame of a university. So they should focus more on EEE. the private have better EEE than the public
"In private universities they provide us with good lab faculities, which is very important as it gives us proper practical experience"
The lecturers we have are doing quite well but it would have been much more better if had few more senior lecturers. Senior lecturers can pravide much more in depth analysis on our courses.
"As a Fresher, I am finding it difficult to understand my course structure since I am new to this open credit system. I am finding it hard to communicate with IT department. I am not happy with our campus security. Furthermost, we need good facculties."
"The course materials provided are good. However, the courses are too short."
"In CSE department, there is a lack of good options when choosing faculties during pre-advising. Most of the faculties are very supportive. Compus is very conjusted . Too many people cramp at a very small space."
After examinations the question paper should be given back.
I would like to get admitted in CSE department of an university higher ranking and good faculties.
I will get admitted in NORTH SOUTH UNIVERSITY in Finance.The reason is this department seems challenging to me..The tuition fee is too high however I will be spendind this money due to their quality education. At the end where ever I get admitted I have to hork hard and be very persistant.
"I want to get admitted in CSE.I personally like universities with interesting subject, achievements, good lab facilities.I don't like too much student. Every semester too many students are getting and not adequate sitting arrangement.I expect my university will provide me a proper campus but they didn't provide it yet."
I am from BRAC UNIVERSITY.I am from BBA department.I like the bondinf between the people in Residential semester.There is not enough space in our main campus. We need a good campus with good line of faculties. I'm sort of satisfied.Few of the faculties were amazing.
Not all the teachers are teaching well but it's enough. With better teaching we could understand better.
The way of teaching is good but the class time is not enough.
As per the lab evaluation we are satisfied with it. Our labs are well equiped.
The more examinations the more it is better for us.
"I am from the department of computer science and engineering. I have chosen to get into this department because I am interested to work with Artificial Intelligence .Mainly we face  accommodation problem for not having a true campus. The academic exellency being resourceful.Intake of mass number of students every semester is a problem. My expectations are to have a bigger campus along with some facilities to be improved.  So far some of the aspects have been addressed. Most of the teachers are really knowledgeable, freindly and helpful beyond class time. "
The university gives us various opportunities and exposure which helps us during our professional career.
Exam pattern is most important. The university has made great efforts on this and we appreciate it
"Teachers are Knowledge and good ,but depth of course is not good enough. Course material are not upto the mark."
I am from pharmacy department. Bigger facilities are required. Not getting expected grades is demoralizing .Small campus with over Population is a problem.Teachers are Friendly and the provide us with maximum time ..
"I am from CSE. I like CSE because of better job prospect.I look into an university's Achievement.We have a Very bad campus and overcrowded, we have to cross roads to get to university buildings.We have Very good teachers, some peers are very active a few administrative offices contribute a lot towards a better university.The main problems are No parmanent  Campus, no place for recreation, extremely easy admission test, overcrowded and quality of my peers(very low not all). The positive part is Good education but sometimes our topics seems to be too easy so I might be unprepared for the future. Residential semester is the best part."
The content of course should be increase with depth.
"Basically I want to learn about computer science for exploring it's vast field. An university's reputation, educational quality are the most important aspects. Lack of space in our campus is a problem. Educational quality becomes poor due to lack of space for students. The teachers are very friendly."
"Sometimes study burden is so  much that we can not participate in other activities .Therefore, one activity should be made complusory for every student like all other courses."
I mostly enjoy lab work. The more lab work the better it is.
Scholarship is what i am looking for when selecting universities. I want to transfer to a foreign university in the future.
It's good when compare with my Biotech lectures and teaching activities.
I  want to participate in extra carricular activities but i can't take part in those activities because of my studies.
Clubing activies in unversity  seems to me a very good system since it is a good source of interaction with other and to built a leadership quilities and to overcome our faults.
The quality of eduction is good but it would be better if  the standard of Courses could be inproved. 
"Teachers are good in subject,and punctuality. They are very helpful."
Teachers give us all the information required to improve the performance. I am thankful to them.
I want to join army after graduation. Achievements of an university is the most important thing. Facilities are important as well.  Teachers take care personally and Class schedule is important.
"The teachers are good it , but teachers do not want to  consider the ideas of students ."
"The online system in library usually does not work , so it creates a problem for us to issue books."
I got into BRAC UNIVERSITY BBA because I wanted to learn about business studies.Open credit system provides us flexibility and Residential Campus is the best part.I expected to learn about how to become a good businessman but they only taught us to be good management skills.The teachers are highly qualified.
Achievments and quality of education are the plus points of the university.
Content of the courses should be changed a bit. More of industry oriented feature like Linux and GitHub must be implemented. Proper detailing and advanced knowledge is required and is to be instilled in the students.The course material is good.
I am from BBA department. The best best thing about my unversity is quality of education and clubing activities. The teaches are very friendly.
I am from Architecture department. Cost of education is too much and temporary campus is a problem. There are good as well as poor teachers.
The university should provide us with some libarties .
"Returning the question paper after the exams to be expected,because to clear and clarify the doubts regarding particular subjects."
We need 24 hour residential facilities .
Most Universities in Bangladesh lacks technology for research work.
Extracurricular activities are good. It helps people to know their talent and build up their skills.
University needs a bigger campus.
Exam Paper checking can be improved .
Very poor education in private universities because often they do not have good teachers and facilities .
Very Tough Curicullum In Private Universities. Easier curicullum would be much appritiated.
Super quality of teaching  but exam paper checking is not good enough.
I am from EEE because I like electronics. The teachers are good. Having a campus or not having it is not a problem.
"The quality of labs are not satisfactory, lab work must include latest technologies."
it's good to have a negative marking pattern in exam but the time is not sufficient to do all the questions.
It is good to learn from labs but the lab instruments are not properly working.
"Exam pattern and how it is conducted is  good .But in my first year and when I went to scrutiny for the first time it was not as per my expectations. Teachers have marked the answers as per their choice, they must look for the content rather than the length of answers. Poor paper checking is the main problem."
LAB IS VERY GOOD In the Private Universities
I am from Department of Architecture. I chose this subject simply because I always wanted to be an architect.NSU is well renowned and has better facilities than most universities. I think these aspects influenced me to choose NSU. And of course the campus was a major factor.I personally didn't face that many problems in my university but it has some authoritarian issues that they should be conscious of. Faculties are highly qualified.Authority takes a lof of time to solve any problem.Authority should invest more to improve facilities.Teachers are great. Facilities are good but could be better.
Due to averge quality teachers the quality of education is also Average in private universities.  Facilities in Private Universities needs to be improved.
Teachers are not giving depth of course . They are only trying to cover there work .
It is very good to be studying in a private university because of their modern method of teaching.
Examination in private universties are a pain in the neck. The examination patterns can be changed.
Best for Engineering Are Private Universities because of their facilities.
I am really enjoying my private university experience because I like the politics free environment.
Private University are only after our money. The quality of education in terms of the money provided is absurd.
"I am from BRAC UNIVERSITY,CSE. Good Teachers Matter, Some teachers are good , some of them bad."
I am from CSE.It has a high market demand and seemed a good choice.Achievements of the university is the most important.There are too many students in our small campus.Good Facilities required.
"I like communication activity is classes,courses are good."
lab work is quite good in private universities.
There are no sufficient lab equipments in the labs and the avilable equipments are also not perfect.
Private univerity students are generally thought to be less qualified than public university students.
Mid term exam formats can be changed.
Teacher are punctual but they should also give us the some practical knowledge on the topics.
Quality of education in private universities are not good enough.
I like my university . All teachers and facilities are extramly good.
Our labs do not have all facilities.
The environment in Private Universities is like a family. We all take care of each other.
I am from Law. I was Interested in knowing the legal system of our country. Subjects and it's reputation is most important for universities. Definitely the campus is the main issue.. The grading system needs to be improved. a bigger campus is required. Tuition fees is too high.
well and good infrastructure and have trending software in lab
Awful quality of education. Good Image Outside But A Mess In Reality.
EXAM PATTERN IS GOOD AND MARKS DISTRIBUTION IS ALSO GOOD AND PAPER CHECKING IS VERY HARD.
All things are good. I don't think any improvements are required.
LPU gives the best opportunity for the students to show their talent.
I like reading books in Library.
"I am from CSE because my father wanted me to study cse but he didn't pressurized.Achievements and subjects are most important while choosing universities.Faculties  don't teach properly so I have to learn it on my own which I feel like waste of my tuition fees.I am also doing 6 or 7 days classes per week ,which is quite tiring.Faculties of cse department are quite friendly.Small cafe, no place to sit and too many students.Teachers who are more qualified are needed.The university hhould intake a very small number of students until a bigger campus is ready. We need better PC in our lab. CSE faculties are really nice and approachable but EEE faculties are scary. "
"I am from BRAC UNIVERSITY, BBA . I selected BBA because I wanted to learn about business.BBA because I wanted to learn about business. Open credit system in most important part of an university."
content tought is not sufficient for us. More topics needs to be added.
All books are not available in the library. The library needs to be improved.
More extra curicullar activites needs to be introduced. Eveyone has to perticipate in such activities.
"I am from CSE as I'm interested in problem solving and pattern. I choose my university on the basis of fees. As i'm an bangla medium student & an introvert person I'v struggled a lot in my 1st year, couldn't understand my lesson couldn't get enough resources. As a result got bad gpa . The best part is that you are free to choose your faculty and courses Practical knowledge.  Our teachers mostly focus on theory rather than practical implementation which is sad.  I was expecting to learn application of programming in real life which is not fullfilled. The teachers are quite friendly ."
"I am from CSE. Basically I want to learn about computer science for exploring it's vast field.An university's reputation, educational quality matters most.Lack of space and Educational quality is a matter of concern.With the Lack of space for students ,I am not satisfied at all.Teachers are friendly."
The teachers  are extraordinary so I am happy with my university
Subjects taught are appropriate but much depth is required as syllabus includes only basics not the details.
A bigger campus with better facilties are required. The number of new students intake should be lessened.
Library facilities are good for students. This is most important for students.
The Unversity is quite good .The quality of it depends upon teacher and their experience.
"My unversity's examination pattern, marks distribution, paper checking is good. This are the things that I was looking for."
"Actually I am searching University on the basis of their accomplishments and facilities . And of course which offers best under less cost.  BRAC University ,North South University ,IUB,AIUB ,EWU. I have passion in mechanical engineering and computer science engineering . But unfortunately there aren't much option for mechanical engineering . Only a few Private Universities offer mechanical engineering . So I have to take computer science engineering . There must be a good environment for learning and politics free environment of course . And University should introduce various plans for new research and development activities . Financial aid for research and development should be given . More scholarship programs should be introduced for meritorious students and for higher studies University should help students in case of finding foreign Private Universities . "
The problem with unversities is that they very strcitly evalute marks.
Everything with private universities are good. They provide all the best facilities.
Lab practicals and class evaluations are below average and need lot of changes and improvements.
"In private universities we often find a very rough class timings and too many assignments, which hampers our study."
The exam script checking is very strict. Often the teachers don't want to give good grades to the students.
There is not special about private univerties. Private universities are all about money.
The faculties are very dependable and trustworthy. Then know what they are teaching.
There are many good and qualified teachers but few lacks in interaction with students and fails to describe a topic.
"I'm from CSE, Brac University.The culture of this University matches more with my culture. Here most students are focused into studies than any other University. Moreover, it has one of the best CSE department of this Country.  Not Getting proper courses timely ,no place to sit Quietly And everything is a bit too congested are the main problems.  It genuinely educates us to be a perfect and qualified man for job and life.The Open Campus and Its Rented Buildings is something that I hate. The Expectations are a Campus which is being told to be satisfied but when, it is not yet sure. 
Moreover,  expectations are also to reduce the tution fees which will never be reduced unfortunately.  University Teachers are great but not all of them. But most of them are helpful. The facilities are good but not the Best."
Easily available course material with sufficient knowledge gaining are the main advantages of studing in private university.
"I'm from NORTH SOUTH UNIVERSITY,Architecture department.Campus Facilities are the best.Grading Policy is the worst. Grading policy is the only problem as most university is good."
"Everything is very good. Interaction part is something like teachers mostly interact with each and every student, lecture delivery is very good and punctuality always maintains."
I am from CSE Department.Brac University.I have chosen this subject as this in demand.I happy everything about my university.Grading and less holidays are the main problems.The teachers are generally good.
Our library contains all the books regarding courses and other materials and very cooperative library staff.
The quality of education is not good at all. The teachers are average.
Right now The private univerties are doing better than the public unversities. The reason behind this politics free campus.
Private universities have got excellent work environment. The teachers are well paid.
Private universities provides us with best pattern of examination.
"The private universities are good ,Mostly everything  depends on the quality of teacher's knowledge and student's interest."
The labs are the best part of being in a private university.
I am from Brac business school. The best part is that our unversiity is a english medium univesity. Along with our studies we can learn english.
Library facilities are excellent.The system in terms of searching books is really good.
There is nothing good about private universities.They don't have good teachers or any facilities.
Its important to have a good campus .But most of the private universities do not have a proper campus.
I am from CSE department. Subject and achievements are most important for an university.  Not having a permanent campus is a big problem. The university will help us to gather experience about further life and will help us to grow up our connections which can help us in our job life. the teachers are. Very friendly.
Extracurricular is something that motivates us. Such more activities should be introduced.
Most universities are money making institutions obviously except public. Most of the universities are not preparing the students for the future .They just makes a lot of money.
I study Biochemistry and Biotechnology .Subject and Faculties are most important.I love our teachers and the way they reach out to us. I want to see students achieve good grades.Sometimes there are few teachers who are not friendly.
The material provided is beneficial and provides much knowledge.
Teaching delivery is good but it is better to reduce there speed of lecture delivery to understand the student better.
"I choose CSE, because I had an interest towards computers.Subject and Campus are the important while finding the best university.Our teachers are not very capable and we need a campus."
I love my private university becuase my beautiful girls go there.
CSE. HUGE Reputation Having no campus is the major problem now. It's faculties and my friendsNo space. And too much student. I don't like chaosNo expectations from them. 
"our university is good in terms of lecture delivery,interaction and punctuality"
course content is knowledgeable here in the privates
labwork is horrible. We need better lab facilities
practicals are pretty well.But better lab equpments would have made things better.
BBA Finance. Because my future interests are related to businessesBest Private University for BBAQuality of student bodyFaculties and access to resourcesStudent qualityMy expectations from my university is whether it can help me be someone who can leave behind a legacy and establish change. So far it is hard to say whether or not the university has satisfied that.Great
"The faculty is good ,interaction between student and teacher is also good"
"very good teaching facilities, lecture given are fruitful and teachers are punctual"
University in Bangladesh must include international facilities.
extracurricular activities are also good and this helps us in future.
EEE is good in Brac university Onk problem Tarc Campus Help me to be a better human being 
Perfect University is Private Ones
content provided by you is excellent so that we learnt more and more about that particular subject
Private Universities are not goverment's lab dogs
"CSE,Its close to my home and is good for engineering. No campus and very crowded.Faculties are very helpful. No proper campusSome are being satisfied but its taking too long.They are very helpful."
"Subject: Applied Chemistry or Genetic Engineering.
Fees should be like public varsities.
I am looking for some facilities which wont count on any specific community but for all. 
Dhaka University
North South University
Chittagong University
Jahangirnagar University      Applied chemistry or genetic Engineering because both have research facilities and I want to invent something new and beneficial for people which is connected to chemistry or biology.     My University will give me confidence to do anything. I hope my University will never be a reason of my discomfort on anything.  "
"CSE,Popularity Accomodations, Pretty girls, Lack of space, Moving to permanent campus ASAP"
"BRAC UNIVERSITYCSECSEStandardQuality educationTheir policies are damn too weird. They hardly think about student when they never forget their business purpose. Not at all! Before getting admitted in 2015, I heard about the permanent campus! We really wanted to see that! Student wants memories!  Unfortunately we do not have any memory related to campus! That's why we miss TARC the most. We must be given a proper UNIVERSITY campus.          75% Wonderful , 20% need some improvement and 5% never deserves to be faculty.    75% Wonderful , 20% need some improvement and 5% never deserves to be faculty.    "
excellent but checking procedure is not exceptable since we fail to know our faults in mid term..
IT IS VERY MUCH USEFUL AND WE CAN PARTICIPATE IN OUR INTERESTS
Lab or practical work is excellent and yes including evaluations also.
"I study Environmental Science. To know,explore and preserve the nature. To get closer to my purpose.Subject,achievements and facilities are most important.No one Connects us with the outter world.Our university Helds workshop seminars etc."
3 hours practical is so long. It should be of 2 hours only.
"Interaction is very good,accurate supplement material is provided but recommendation of books is very poor,the change of a particular teacher after 3 months or a semester of same subject causes problems."
"i am from CSE. I guess somewhat due to the trend and probably this department will give me more job opportunities. I somewhat liked computers and CSE graduates do earn a hefty salary .Advertisements, reputation , SubjectThe university doesn't have proper available transportation system. Doesn't have a campus of it's own. Not enough facilities for extracurricular activities.The departmental Faculties are well qualified.Doesn't have a campus of it's own.Expected a good management system. A good course management system would be nice. The university should make more places for student activities.The Faculties are good and experienced.I think the university shouldn't be so hesitant and close-fisted in making changes for students so that they might have a better university life."
"Some lectures are excellent,but not everyone is good at giving lectures. Better teachers are required."
"I am from Bachelor of Business Administration. Reduced  Tution Fees,Facilities , Job related course, Scholarship System, Career related course must be introduced. More facilities and Try to Increase University campus.To ensure each student can get proper facilities and Environment.Faculty are good but facilities are poor. University is a place where students learn knowledge not education. Each University should ensure facilities,environment for students."
University in Bangladesh must include international facilities & more empowerment.
I'm definitely looking for the best university for studying cse.Ahsanullah University Of Science & Technology is the best for Computer Science & Engineerin.I like cse because I love coding and building up the algorithms.Expecting a better facility from my unversity.More practical than the theoretical about studies are needed.Teachers should be friendly.And their must be a good environment for knowledge.
Lab and practical are not upto the mark. The topic which are practiced are almost already done before.
"I study CSE, As I thought it was my passion Subject. Firstly,tuition costs are rising at alarmingly high rates. Secondly too much students for a little campus and lastly have no field to play. Quality of education, Faculty and research facilities are the best.The fee is too high.I am satisfied with my university. The teachers are Good and friendly."
"The pattern in which the total marking is done is very complicated. Adding Class tests, mid terms , lab , attendance and assignments along with finals."
Overall the quality of education is the best. The teachers are very friendly.
"I am from English Department. I chose it because I like English and it is a multipurpose subject.Fees and facilitiesexcessive rulesDisciplinepractice of excessive rulesQuality, dedication, commitment and improvement. Some are being satisfied and some are not.Teachers are standard and facilities are being improving.Not really"
The quality of teachers are good but it would be better if  the standard of Courses could be improved. 
Private universities are money grabbing hous.
Excellent teachers  but sometimes lack of books in libraries especially during exam times.
"EXAM PAPER CHECKING IS VERY HARD ,REMAINING IS GOOD"
"I am from Department of English & Modern Language, NSU. It’s one of the best university in Bangladesh with all the best facilities."
The pattern of courses are perfect in private universities.
Education has become too expansive and lack research based activites are main problems.
Here we are able to do every thing by our own with our teachers valuable support.
"I am from BRAC UNIVERSITY.My desired department was Computer Science and Engineering.  Before being enrolled in the university I did not know much about my desired subject but as days went by gradually I was acquiring in depth knowledge about computer science and I was liking it.Quality education was the prime factor. Other than that the teachers were cooperative and BRAC University tends to maintain strict standard on all aspects.  Quality education was the prime factor. No university campus, overcrowded university premises are the main problems.My expectation from my university was to learn new things and be prepared for the upcoming challenges in life. Overall, I was satisfied but there are more scopes for improvement. University teachers were cooperative and facilities can be further improved. University teachers were cooperative and facilities can be further improved. "
Library facilities are very good. No issues
Students that do not student student hard often gets poor marks.One must study properly in order to get good grades.
Extracurricular activities are good and provide a good platform.
"Interaction is very less ,when it comes to lecture delivery.It is still fine but the co cordination is not there between the lectures."
I study CSE. I have a lot of interest in computer since I was a child.Department faculties with better knowledge based education is needed..Lack of space and lack of playing field is a problem.Residential semester is most enjoyable.Very small place for a renowned private University is something to be ashamed of.In hope of seeing an actual CAMPUS. Only God and BRACU itself knows whether it is being met or not.Some teachers are the best and most of them are good. 
The university lacks proper resources. It has no environment to study in .The resources provide here are not enough   
Evaluation method is good.But the content is more to write in file.
"I study Philosophy. I didn't choose it, it chose me.Fees are most important in selecting universities. I study for free at public university. Also I don't have to rely on parents to live my life anymore.Most of the students are dumb. And I can't relate to the smart ones in my class, because they're too smart. I'm average. I expect my teachers to understand me. But They don't. Because no one gets me. I'm not satisfied because they have classes at 9 in the morning, for which I have to wake up at 7. Facilities suck, but then, I expect no more since I'm studying for free, quite half-literally. Some teachers are way too cool, and some are poor (no offense). Yeah, I'm interested in the results of your survey. Like why you're conducting it and how and what goals are being met. Please reach out to me at facebook.com/santaniere, if you are able to share the results and related stuff."
Exams conducting is very good .but paper correction is very bad.
The examination pattern is good. More of logic based and subjective questions to be asked which is based upon conceptual learning. Paper checking must be done in a more lucid manner because many doubts arise with the checking of OMR sheet.
Everything would be fine if there are less number of students in our btech CSE.
"I found cse interesting Subject, AchievementsToo many students, Its reputation Campus We need less students"
Grading system of the private University should be changed
they are good but they should give exposure to more students and not the same.
Its fine but it should focus more towards practical knowledge rather than content based. It would be helpful for us.
i have LESS TIME FOR STUDY ...i have LESS TIME FOR PAPER ATTEMTING...LESS TIME FOR EVERY THING ....LESS KNOWLEGE.....LESS DEPTH OF COURSE .....BUT PROPER COURSE MATERIAL ACCORDING TO EXAM
I am studying at cse. The teachers of our department are good but we dont have a campus. that's the worst part of our university. There is not quite place for the students.Always full of people.
"Its the best thing i have seen in this university,albeit the behaviour of library staff is unprofessional at times. They are whimsically rude."
"I love my university, events it is providing, great opportunity for students to learn more instead of just sitting and listening to the lecture. I would recommend it to anyone"
I am from NORTH SOUTH UNIVERSITY and my Department of Biochemistry & Microbiology. I am interested to study about life sciences.Department of Biochemistry & Microbiology. I am interested to study about life sciences.It has a brand value in BD job market.Too many to list down. I expected better laboratory facilities which wasn’t satisfactory in NSUMost of them were good teachers. Most of them were good teachers.
"I am from BRAC University and i am in cse department.
My dream is to be a software engineer.A good education system.Yes.
Every university in our country has to adopt tough laws to exclude rags."
"Economics and Social Science. Development studies had always fascinated me and economics seemed like a good foundation to build upon.Subject and achievements.The influx of students every semester makes the campus crammed but that's unavoidable. The coursework is rigourous and quite stressful.Most of the faculties are helpful, be it coursework, research or advice on future prospects.The short semesters.My expectations from my university are mostly to provide me with the resources I require to further my education. So far, I haven't been disappointed. The university acquires books for me if the library does not possess them and our department helps us acquire datasets when we need them."
Content of the courses is good but some courses need improvement. Course material is not upto the mark.
The university is good but give us a lot of pressure
"My overall college experience has been quite enjoyable. This is because, the staff are friendly, proffessional and understanding to any needs that you may have."
We have a very good library facilities.Issuing time of book must be increased
"School of Law. Always wanted to be a lawyer. Best private university for LawNo campus The Brand itself studying in buildings. Feels like coaching centre Campus Campus Campus Teachers - 50 50 
Facilities - 40/100 Good luck"
"Teaching is excellent,but lecture delivery is not up to the mark.Punctuality is good"
"i am in BBA because i like business.Standard of education is good.LESS space and Too much pressure and no good scholarship.Education HIGH FEES, NO SPACE."
good but marks are not given properly. grading system is overally horrible.
"I am really happy to be studying at BBS. I like the family atmosphere provided. The fact that it is a small university, everyone is made really accessible and help can be seeked at any time. The student community is really tight and everyone knows everyone. Senior students are always happy to help and answer questions. It is a lot of work but you can feel yourself improving every day. I love the combination between theory and practicals. Moreover, the nutrition clinic, naturopathy and dissections are great additions. The tutors and other lecturers are all really knowledgeable and approchable. Coming from a foreign country, I am certain that I made the right decision choosing bbs for my education."
we have a excellent librery facilities. Pretty large collection of books
All the terms are good regarding the university activities.
lab practical work can further be improved so that it can meet industrial standards
My university is so so not very great but okay! What else you can expect from a bangladeshi University.
"Well appointed workshops, classrooms with reasonable IT provision. Library has laptop computers that can be signed out by students as well as desktop computers. Online digital library available as well as hard copy literature. Canteen serves nice food on site.Supportive tutors deliver interesting lectures. Staff are approachable and will find time to give additional guidance if asked. I'm very much enjoying the course although it is very hard."
"I love my university, events it is providing, great opportunity for students to learn more instead of just sitting and listening to the lecture. I would recommend it to anyone"
Some of the lecturers have a bad teaching style but others are very good and catch your attention . Good use of theory and practical
"I really enjoy the open and inclusive atmosphere we have here on campus. Tutors are almost always available to chat, and all the staff I’ve met have helped me to feel supported and at ease"
"Content of courses are good, these are very knowledgeable, depth of course is also there but sometimes proper course material is not there."
"Exam pattren is good, marks distribution is also good bt paper cheacking is very tight."
"The most important things to me are regular and easy access to facilities and getting support from academic staff. The university already offers exceptional, personal support from academic and non-academic staff, and we’re able to book laboratories and specialist equipment regularly. I would like to see more opportunities for placements and professional experiences"
"Very bad experience. Course treated, handled and organised poorly"
Satisfied but universities are giving too much pressure on students which i cant supportNot satisfied
I have loved the uni so far. My classes have all been stimulating and interesting. For instance I have never done biology in school but I took a biology elective and it was hard but I loved learning new things
coming to the courses these are very well planned... and it all depends on the lectures.
Zoology. no option to choice other subject achievement don’t face any problem Don't know nothing to get good education all r very goodi just want a good job after completingmy graduation
"The thing that matters most to me is achieving good grades. Feedback is provided with all work both academic and practical, and the option is always there to speak with the marker personally as well. I want the sense of getting students ready for the 'real world' to continue and improve."
excellent.university is the best while providing facilties and etc .. for extra curricular activities
"Day by day, universities cost grew up, bt their services and study quality is not sufficient and enough."
Knowledge and depth of the course is good but while coming to the material it's not upto the mark.
All terms are good regarding the university activities.Knowing that there is a good chance of employability for graduates and the ability to gain industry experience are essential for me.
some of our faculty member are not so experienced that's why most of the time we are facing problems subjects like CSE
Needs to improve the education style.They should put more education pressure.
My university experience had been amazing so far I am slightly over halfway through my first year and I have already made lot of new friends and met lots of new people from all over the world. My social life has never been better and the work load although hefty is manageable allowing me to get the most out of my university experience and learn the most I possibly can.
"Best Business School in Bangladesh is IBA.Strong alumni network and quality of studentsReputation in the job market Quality of Faculties Best quality education and preparing well for the corporate world - No and Yes respectively Most were average, some were good a few were exceptional Most were average, some were good a few were exceptionalI was a student of IBA - DU (There was no way of specifying this in the first option)"
"I am loving university, both the social side and my classes. I am learning to be independent and making friends and memories. My course is exactly how i would expected it to be and i am loving living away from home."
"Feels crowded and more like a coaching center.Useful career direction, crowded Own campus, innovative study, more practical knowledge oriented rather than theoritical Old ones are better."
"So far, being a first year student, I've enjoyed a lot if aspects about university. The work load is extraordinary but it comes with the course I chose. My biggest fear going into Uni was meeting new people but now, through events organised by my courses society, I have a great group of pals both within and outwith the course."
"examination pattern is good but,,there is blunder mistake.that is we ha no alternate to check the mistake where we have done morever no question papers also not given for discussion.so i suggest to..provide option for checking mistakes in the MCQ exams such as midterm."
"staff and faculty members are always available for interaction, very punctual and delivery of lecture can be improved"
"Fees and achievements are important for a university. I am in North south University, i am doing my MBA, cause I want to be a graduate and i want to get a good job"
CSE is my subject.Proper Practical Education is needed.Student are Friendly.We have no campus.Satisfied Former Alumni
some of them are very helpful and knowledgeable and some are just formality
not a lot to say just really stressful and not a good experience. Timetables need to improve. If you are looking to sing your own music and concentrate on writing your own songs this is not the uni for you.
Syllabus isnt brief enough.library is awesome and rich
Intimidation from a few students and a few lectures. Not organised way of teaching. Most Lectures fail to keep noisy and disrespectful students under control. Not enough time in lectures. Tutorials are rushed. Not the most friendly and supportive environment.
library facilities are good . Every book is available in the library
My Univeristy experience is average.in one term there should be only two major subjects based on numerical
This university experience is worse than dull. It destroyed the keen learner in me. What’s worse is some other departments seem fine but the psychology department has nobody to keep them in check.
"waste ,library is not the good place to study.I am in my final year, and I can safely say that joining pearson has been the biggest regret of my life. Not to mention the cost of the mistake. I do not recommend you join this university"
University has been enjoyable and lectures have been informative and engaging.
"Knowledgeable is Good, Depth of course is satisfying, proper course material is also good"
This is one of the worse experiences i have ever had. I have had several breakdowns (i had experienced none before i went to this uni) because of the self-centered nature of the lecturers and university. No support what so ever. When i inquire about support I receive nothing. I am thinking of transferring to a different university because the experience has been so bad. DO NOT GO TO THIS university
Well organised and maintained. uni has been a great experience for me so far. i enjoy my course and the friends i have made. my advice would be make sure the uni you should is the one you want.
knowledge is maximum gained by reading books also the teachers explain depth if we are interested to know about it.
i am in CSE dept. I have a passion for doing research and development subject. we have a shitty campusI Extremely disappointed would not recommend. The course content is interesting but teaching styles and lectures let this down! The course is so organised and this shows through students grades
"CSE, wanted to learn about computersAchievementsCg komCampus naiEverythingNo expectationGoodNo"
LLB. Because I'm passionate about this subject. There's no campus.They provide the best education. Not enough space.We need Good campus
"The teaching material is excellent, far better than what I experienced in two face-to-face universities. Tutor support is also excellent in my experience."
Overall my university experience has been good. I felt welcomed upon arrival and continue to feel welcome. All queries are answered kindly and promptly. The accomation is situtated in a great location which allows me to maximise my university experience and have been paired with great flat mates
"Well... all the books are not avilable . If they are in library , books are in less number and strength of student are large."
"The evaluation is again bad for our CA, as one of our faculty is really weird. He gives us remarks on the basis of how we present things in front of it, he never look for the content of our answer, which is really annoying. As he expects us to deliver answer in the way he wants us to do. But how can a person do that, as people do have different mentality and they do explain themselves in different manner, so a teacher must understand that quality of a child and should give him marks on the basis of what they say not what they should say."
CSE. It was somewhat my parents' influence and also this subject to be at the top that made me choose it. The campus used to be near my house. Education policy is very strict. It's very hard to maintain good grades with strict faculties and education policy and also the huge competitiveness. It's campus. Huge amount of pressure given to the students and not caring whether they can cope with it or not. I would like to learn and gain knowledge as much as possible while staying here. But all the pressure of maintaining a good grade doesnt allow that. Teachers are well educated but not all are well suited in teaching . Facilities are good.
courses are also good .but lt of subjects in cse departments at 1st year it feels like burden upon us
lab evaluations are pretty good .they help us a lot.. we can actually learn stuff.
Needs to improve the education style.They should put more education pressure.
The books that are recommended do not contain appropriate content; leads the students to depend on slides given by teachers. Hence the knowledge remains superficial
excellent ...they work hard..their way of teaching is also pretty good
"First semester's modules could have been more targeted to learning software. A few pointless modules e.g TRAP. Overall not too bad, could use more independent learning resources."
"CSE. I like to play with computer.facilities are good.Space Shortage of University area.Too many people to meet and get helped and learn everything new daily.No Space for Indoor games(Only Carom and Table Tennis) and outdoor gamesWant to go abroad for higher studySome are so much friendly like kids, some are like Hitler . Just want to change the education system, like if I am studying only in Computer Science or even other fields then I might have a little knowledge about other courses but not force to learn other departments courses.Because it knocks out from the path of the determination that we are focusing on. It's good to be brilliant and be knowledgeable but for a development country we might focus to be like Developed countries.
Thank you so much for the survey"
"CSE is my subject.this is one of the best University with a lots of facilities and achievements It's very costly and there's no campus to hang aroundTARC
They try to teach you to live by yourself there which is unique.Not having a campusMy expectations is that they should make me skilled/upgrade at my field of work 
They are giving all the opportunity to do so the rest is up to meMost of them are good
There's some bad faculties tooIn my opinion the grading system is kind of tough for us"
"Because I love nature and have a strong desire to protect it.Basically the campus and its reputation.Too much pressure, extreme fees, not good enough facilities, bad facultiesConnectionsSame as ""Problems"" question Expectations are definitely NOT being met. We should have a better course outline, more outward connections, better facilities such as better WiFi etc Mostly not good"
"It has been very pleasant. I've passed all my modules so far and I really like the tutors and other staff. The workload was surprising but it was doable so long as you're not lazy about it. For the first year ,if you have good time management ,you wont need to stress over staying up late to finish projects ,which I assume will be different in the later years ."
"I am at BRAC UNIVERSITY, Computer Science! The curriculum is good.I didnt like tarc.The campus isnt great"
as per the exam pattern maths exam always have to be subjective rather than objective.
Intense and quite difficult as well as support is not available from tutors much because there is not much time to spend with the teacher
"I have really enjoyed my time here, the courses are really interesting, the people that work are here are very nice and know what they're doing, so I could recommend this university to future students."
"BBA, I'd like to work in the business fieldAchievements, the board at BRAC University and the founders are very well known, and a lot of professors have suggested BRAC over other private universitiesThe lack of space, there's no space to spend recreational time in.The quality of education, the teachers, and the value of the degree we're gettingThe lack of spaceUniversity's should have proper campuses, especially in modern times like this. Everything else is great, other than the lack of space. Mostly Great"
some books are not available. So please provide
its very tough and very diffcult to understand
not good..the timing is too much for labs and syllabus is also so vast.we don't get propr revision
content is good enough. We need more good contents.
"i am doing my MBA. Facilities are good.Expensive tuition fees.Tuition Fees are so high.Almost satisfied. There can be some rooms for little improvement.Very helpful and knowledgeableSince you are doing a survey about Bangldesh university scenario, you should include some other factors. Library, common room, canteen facilities, internet and computer accessibility in the campus, extra curricular activities etc"
"BBS, as I want to do a corporate jobEducation quality not having a campus and good library with enough outside books They always try to be updated not concern enough about activities outside academic I expect good academic education with enough outside activities most of them are well qualified and do their job in a way they should do itAll of our universities should try to do research based works rather than thaking exams in a traditional way."
"I am in my final year, and I can safely say that joining pearson has been the biggest regret of my life. Not to mention the cost of the mistake. I do not recommend you join this university, I wish someone had been honest with me before I joined and told me the truth of this place. If anyone is offered a bursary to join, everyone gets it, its just a marketing scheme used to ploy more students in with lower tuition fees but also receive less value for a lower cost of being there."
exam pattern and marks distribution is very well procedure
"I am studying at BRAC university. It was my Parents' decision.Reputation and rating is the best part of the university.there are Lack of resources . Lack of space. Inexperienced teachersEnvironmentToo crowded. Admission exam too easy. Good learning environment. Helpful, career oriented education. Learning soft skills. I'm not satisfied.Okay. Some are good."
"The course content of my department is enough, we donot need more. Our lab activites are also satisfactory. We got a number of great faculties."
The library facilities of my university is very satisfactory. it has an enriched collection of books.
The Education system of my university is good. it was knowledgeable. The depth of the course is good but proper course materials in only for some subjects
Our university has lot of extracurricular going on and it helps us a lot. We can find many opportunities to make us stronger for our future.
Our University must recruit international faculties so that we will be able to learn in a more effective way. Our Library need to be more enriched.
The laboratory of our university provides us a good knowledge about practicals. The faculties have a very good command over the topic.
The course content of my university of my department are very useful to the sudents for physical activity and improvement of knowledge.
In our University we have good teaching delivery. Our faculties are very experienced and has a good interaction with students.
"I choose Journalism as my department. I choosed journalism because this is my passion related Subject, facilities, achievements I can't remembering!! Sorry!! Unity. Management can be better one from now!! Our faculties are Generous, galible, strict, almost perfect!!"
"I am from BRAC UNIVERSITY and from the department of EEE, because i wanted to work in powerplants and wanted to work with engines and turbines specially i got nothing special TARC Campus, contents of courses is Good and favorable Campus but I was not satisfied with it. I was expecting more realistic engineering contents from the courses which was not met. Our Faculties were highly qualified."
Our university is very good but in terms of interaction of teachers with students is not at all fair because they interact with only students understands his/her teaching. They don't make remaining students to understand the topic.
The education system of my university is very helpful. It makes me more knowledgeable for my future career.
The course content of my university improves my knowledge. it enhances the my practical knowledge.
In my university I have to face too much examinations. its very stressful. we don't get enough time for us.
Our exam pattern of Unversity is very nice but paper checking is not at all good. sometimes evaluation is not good.
I am doing my BBA in marketing. I chose marketing cause it’s easier than others Facilities There are class in the morning which is at 8:30 am. Largest green campus.There are no waiting room for the students outside the registre office. I have no expectations.
"I am From BRAC UNIVERSITY and my Department is CSE. The contents of CSE seemed nice to me and the career prospects attracted me. My university focused on research and my department had a really fine set of faculties. Most of our alumnus are in very good position. No campus. However, it took the highest amount of tuition fee in Bangladesh! They intake too many students for CSE. My expectations was my university will make its intake strict and limited. But they didn't do it. Faculties were really nice and qualified. However, during my last period, many faculties went abroad and they took so many junior faculties. Due to lack of a campus, facilities were very few. Faculties were really nice and qualified."
The exam pattern of our university is good and good paper checking. Faculties are not biased.
"Education system is appreciable. Students who are having interest in co curricular activities, getting a good platform."
I am from CSE Department. Because i love to code. Shortage of space in campus. Faculties are not enough. More students. A large library and should have more facilities to do research. Awesome.
My university has a Lot of activities and students get exposure in games.
The whole education system of our university doesn't seem satisfactory to me.
Every thing is excllent but paper checking is not good. Sometimes it seems like biased.
We have a verery good environment. it is a good oppurtunities to many students for learning new things.
We are getting maximum knowledge as our faculties are very experienced. The course content is very helpful for learning new things.
yeah! the education system is good. Well some of the faculty are not teaching well but the schedule of the university are superb. And university asked feedback from us .that is really helpful
Every thing is good. Subjects have a very good depth. Almost all the books are available in the library and more than that 4/5
"I AM FROM CSE DEPARTMENT, I LIKE MACHINES CAUSE I DIDN'T STUDY ENOUGH FOR A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY. THEN I CHOSE WHICHEVER WAS TOP ON THE LIST (ALPHABETICALLY)LACK OF SPACE, STUDENT NUMBER 5X OF THE CAPACITY, CAFETERIA FOOD NOT GOOD AT THE MOMENT (IT WAS GOOD BEFORE)GOOD MANAGEMENT AND STUDENT SUPPORT. AWESOME FACULTIES. ENCOURAGING STUDENTS FOR CREATIVE ACTIVITIES. AND OF COURSE TARCNO CAMPUS, NO HYGIENE CAFETERIA (THE FOOD, SURROUNDINGS ARE GREAT), NOT UPDATED COURSE PLAN AND OF COURSE TAKES A LOT OF MONEY BUT NOT EQUIVALENT FACILITYA GOOD COURSE PLAN, EMPHASIZING ON HELPING STUDENTS SOLVE REAL WORLD PROBLEMS, A HEALTHY ENVIRONMENTOUTSTANDING! (OF COURSE THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS)CAN I GET AN OVERALL RESULT OF THE FINAL DATA !?!?! NVM"
"THE Interaction of faculty with students is satisfied, lecture delivery good,punctuality always on time."
I FOUND THE COURSE IS GOOD BUT I THINK THERE IS NO PROPER COURSE MATERIAL
Our university's education environment is neither too good nor too bad.Its average in most cases.
in our university the content of course is ample but depth must be more. Faculties are well behaved.
I am from NORTH SOUTH UNIVERSITY and my Department is Pharmaceutical Sciences. Faculty Service is very good. Education environment is good.
Our University's Education system is Average standard. Faculties are Good standard
It will provide us various books to increase our knowledge or to understand the concept because it is good
I think private universities are better than public universities. They are career oriented and corporate focused. And provides us with practical based knowlwdge.
As per the courses all the subjects are providing worth knowledge and its very much object oriented.
In my I found that there are many opportunities for students. its all upon students about how they utilize them.
"i am from CSE Department. Because I love coding.subject. Campus is insufficient, lack of seats in sections, messed up advising. The department requires High amount of fees. Not satisfied. Must have a permanent campus. Great!"
I can honestly say if wasn't being paid to be here would not come. Waste of time. Irrelevant and outdated information. have no concept of future innovation and the future only talk about the past. Can now see why university students are so out of touch when it comes to working in the real world as the information they get given at university is totally outdated and inapplicable to real-life scenarios.
Our learning material is quite great and unique. But the class learning content and Examination Question content is not matched in some cases.
The course content is great. I can learn so much from it. it is very practical oriented.
Yes our education system is very good. Every university in our country has to adopt tough laws to exclude rags.
Our Faculty's lecture delivery and punctuality was good but the interaction with students was not good.
"I am from Dept.of Architecture. This was the only subject i felt passionate about. Facilities and campus are good, Biased grading. I wish my dept was less biased towards few students. This only thing almost made me loose interest in my subject. Also nsu has a very difficult grading system compared to other famous universities.which they should consider but they surely dont Biased."
I WAS A STUDENT OF A BOARDING SCHOOL. I STUDIED FOR 7 YEARS THERE RESIDING IN HOSTEL. NOW LIVING IN LPU IS SAME LIKE THAT. AND STILL MORE SAME AND PUNCTUALITY IS SHOWN HERE BY BOTH TEACHERS AND STUDENTS. AND ALSO BY THE STAFF. SECURITY IS ABOVE 90%(IN CASE OF STUDENT IS WELL MANURED) CLASSES ARE REGULAR. SPORTS DAILY. PARTICIPATION WELL. QUALITY BELOW AVERAGE
The extracurricular activities held in our university are very enjoyable and good. Students get huge opportunities
"My experience in this University is very bad and stressful, also not organised. The system is not good enough."
Our university need more funding. Worst campus in the entire planet. our Class Period is very long. its not satisfactory.
"in our University, our faculty's lecture delivery depends on teacher's knowledge, punctuality is good. Examination system is satisfacory."
The academic experience and the overall student experience have benefited my personal development hugely. I have access to fantastic facilities and good libraries.
My university is pretty well i think. i am satisfied with the result. but the cost is very high.
i dont think the education system of our university is good enough. i think it could be better and i am not satisfied with it.
Excellent lectures are delivered by teachers and all teachers are very punctual. They are very good in their field.
Its not effective and satisfactory in terms of lecture delivery by all the faculty. Most of them are not experienced so it has become a problem.
Our Lab and practical works are good. With a little draw back of faculty in connecting the lab practical to the outside world.
"It sucks, I hate it so much it’s so lonely and boring and there’s not enough work to do. There’s nothing to do in the university."
"I am from BBA Department. Because I've been a commerce student from the start and I know it better. Quality of education and campus. Very strict grading system, far from my place.The faculties and the campus are not enough. Strict grading system, too much students getting admitted. Apart from the unlimited intake of students, its fine. Above average"
"I am from CSE Department, I want to be involved in this field in the future with software engineering at its core. We have Reputation, scholarship.There is a Lack of a permanent open campus.Its quality of education is very good..Selecting courses during semester breaksThey are working on a new campus and hopefully will be done by 2021 Very good."
Our University provides good platform to interested students by providing quality education through creating a learning Environment.
Libraries are well enriched but book issuing time should be increased for 2 weeks.
Education system is good. The tuition fees are very high. The retake courses fees should be made lesser.
Our Educaton system is very good. We don't have Campus. Lab Activities are not good. Faculties are very friendly.
This is the best in our university because there is no other university which takes seriously for practical work. Lab activities are well.
Our University provides good platform to interested students by providing quality education through creating a learning Environment. We need more faculties though
Lab evaluations are very strict but learning is not satisfactory. Contents are very hard to understand. Faculties are not interested to give a clear view about a particular topic.
"Education system and environment is good, teachers deliver the lectures in the best way they can and we find it easy to understand. They help us whenever we need any academic support."
LIbrary contains Insufficient books. Faculties are not helpful. Most of them are not experienced so we face several problems.
I aint that much interested to talk about my university. It sucks.
"From the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. I chose it because this was my second option to chose after medical and also i found myself interested in website designing. BRAC University is one of the best academic universities where i can get a lot of opportunities to build up my career. Time management issues and not getting expected courses with desirable faculties. Also we don't have a campus. Festives, occasions and clubing is fantastic here. Not getting expected courses with desirable faculties. Also we don't have a campus. Another thing, University expense is very costly. Expectations are: We will have our courses with desirable faculties. For the retake courses university should take less money(50% of the usual payment of one course).Having main campus. Sincere and helpful faculties. Some of them are so good, but as some of them are inexperienced, so we face problems while doing the class. Some of them are enough qualified but couldn’t guide us properly."
All activties are good. Lab activities are good. Education system is practical life oriented.
From the Department of LLB. This was the first university where i got the chance. No campus here. Nothing. Everything Only to survive some are extremely not good.
We have good library facilities. LIbraries are enriched with a good collection of books. Labs are well equipped.
"As per libraries, few books are not available and in computer library there are hardly 5 PCs working."
Everything is fine other than the fees..Although I didn’t face that kind of problems yet but my friends face it. Back to back classes on other side of the roads is really exhausting and i have seen my friends to miss 20 min lectures despite running. My faculty of maths is the best. 
Lab activities are good but not satisfactory in explaining point of view.
Education System is very good. I think this is upto the mark. Great for me.
Exam pattern is completely different. The entire exams are objective oriented resumbling the education in abroad. My review is 5/5
From CSE Department. We have Best Space and we are provided by Quality education. Campus area almost satisfied. Education is not Good enough.
I am from BBA Department. Grading policy is hard. Faculty Administrative is not Good.
"Most of the private universities suck. They don't maintain certain qualities, there's no standard which all universities can follow so that we can compare/evaluate every graduate in a proper way. Few well known Public universities are doing good. However, there's room for improvement. As a student of BRAC university, i can say that the overall performance is satisfactory.However, there's still a lot of work which needs to be done to become the best private university in Bangladesh. For instance, campus area, sufficient well qualified faculties, research and real life work oriented study plan etc should be introduced as soon as possible."
Content of course is more than enough to get the basics of that particular subject.
In my University interaction between students and teachers is good. Lecture is delivered in time and also the teachers are very punctual.They are very helpful and also want us to get good marks so they always give their best.
Our university is well planned and the syllabus of the courses are also up to the mark.We get good grades and also wish to have a brighter future.
It is very interesting to study in my University. I enjoy a lot here. All the people are very nice to me and so I am very happy here.
"The content of the courses are good but depth of courses are not enough to get the good concepts. So, I think that the contents should be up to the mark. "
Private University in Bangladesh has campus issues and so we face many problems. And for this reason students prefer public universities more. 
"The content of the subjects are good but some teachers do not upload the powerpoints on time. So, we face a lot of problems."
All lecturers are giving their best to teach the students perfectly so that the students don't face any problems. And so I am very proud  of it.
"My department is CSE. I like coding. it is a  kind of riddles and obviously it has many fields. For example: Subject, achievements and facilities.  It feels like that it's just that day we got admitted and now we have mids. So obviously I am facing problem to keep pace with their speed.   Everything is fine other than the fees..Although I didn’t face that kind of problems yet but my friends face it. Back to back classes on other side of the roads is really exhausting and i have seen my friends to miss 20 min lectures despite running. My faculty of maths is the best. "
way of teaching is average. As a result we face a lot of problems in understanding and cannot do a good result.
My department is mathematics and there is no space here which I do not like it at all.
I did never visited the library of my university so I am unable to share my experience.
everything is good but when coming to some lecturers who dont have a good grip on subject becomes and issue . They dont behave well with students and  dont even teach all the concepts in the subject.
3 hours of lab is very long and is quite hectic so for this reason I do not like the system of my university
The library is absolutely fine.  All books are there but the thing is that the time limit is very less and  we have to return the book that we have issued very fast
"Interaction between students and teachers is good .The lectures delivery is fine, and their punctuality is good too"
"My experience in this University is very bad and stressful, also not organised. The system is not good enough."
it is good for refreshment.  And for this reason I can easily pass my leisure time in the campus
I got admitted in BRAC UNIVERSITY CSE because I had passion and love towards this field since I was a kid. Everything is fine apart from the campus.I Wanted a quality education and I got it and so my feedback is Excellent.
Lack of faciliies in the universiy and so for this students face many problems in studying here.
It has a fair marking scheme and adaptable pattern and so is very suitable for the students
I got  admitted in CSE. Here nothing is fine. Everthing is very disorgannized and my feedback is the worst regarding my university.
Extracurricular activities is held in our university and so I like it the most.
It has been a wonderful experience in my university. And I am proud of it
Private University in Bangladesh has excessive tuition fees which is a very big problem because most of the people cannot afford it.
Private universities are for those who have a lot of money and so most of the people cannot study here
"As compared to other colleges and universities,  our university is perfect in all the aspects."
Our faculties are excellent  but they reduce the speed of teaching  and so  the students faces problems in understanding the concepts 
"My department is Environmental science and management.   For huge number of students it seems like that our campus is getting smaller day by day. So space has become our big problem now a days.
Relationship Between students and honorable facultys is so amazing  .There is a  bookshop(Jalil shop) where extra Money for all the books,pen and study related anythig is taken.      Human can not be satisfied, and im a Human. If i talk about the facultys then Some of them are very good. But sometimes some of them are not. 
And if i talk about the facilities, we need more"
in terms of lecture delivery and  punctuality our university is good but in terms of intraction it is very bad. There are some teachers that donot interact and do not listen to our problems which means that lack of co-operation exists.
"some time lab is not proper working , some teacher's practical knowledge is less on the other side evaluations is not that much good"
My department is Economics & Social Sciences.  I chose this one because i thought there is a lot of opportunities ahead for the studentsof Economics.  The facilities are good but there is a  Huge number of students but no permanent campus. Along with the studies it appreciates the other activities.    And nobody allows  bullying and harassment.   We have a Small space.I expect from my university to have more lecturers and more space.So basically our teachers are very much helpful and kind and resourceful. 
"My department is Cse.
Enough job opportunities is the reason why I had chosen it.  It does not provide a healthy environment for studying since the amout of students are increasing and the university is being crowded . "
"In labs,the lecturers has to interact with each student to improve their knowledge, in all the ways,before giving us the work they must explain about the experiment once so that we will come to know how to perform and take precautions while doing it."
CSE many job fields will be open + coding is funSubject and achievementsNo Campus so lot of travelling from one building to the otherTARCroad crossing Expectations include a more lenient form of communication with the faculties and in many cases these are fulfilled but not in allMost of them are nice 
I find my university fine in  a way because it is well disciplined and maintained
everything is good in my university and also the courses are fine and interesting
some courses are irrelevant as they are not related to my stream so I find this thing very stupid.
My department is CSE. The authority doesn't care about how the people study. It only cares about getting money. The facilities are not up to the mark. I want my university to improve more.
"Talk about punctuality, it's really good but the lecture delivery is somehow not appreciated because every teacher has different style of teaching, so lack of knowledge in terms of subject is there and interaction is also kind of boring. A teacher should be entertaining as well but they are really not. All they want us to stay disciplined which is really not the thinking of every student."
"I chose BBA department beecause BBA of Nsu is the best  among all private universities  of Bangladesh for reputation,Facilities ,Experienced,Smart & cool faculties,& mainly for providing  USA curriculum based quality education. It is Over populated and has Poor wifi and mobile network connection I have to suffer a lot During advising (like not getting expected course). For our grading method Education quality & Campus facilities Grading system, I expect that our university shouldn’t  pressurise much over us & advising should me more better. I love my university a lot.Despite having some problem we usually  face a lot,I admire that my university is one the best university in Bangladesh.It should be more better in every way"
the faculties are amazing and help to boost our stamina and so we enjoy a lot
"I am from BRAC Business School. I have chosen this department because I am a commerce background student, who is passionate regarding Business related studies. It has a great Reputation and Excessive academic pressure.
It has a very rigid grading policy. It's ranking is very high. My expectation is so that I can get a good job and I will understand it after completing graduation."
content of the courses are updated and mostly based on current technology. And so we can cope up with the current updates 
"I am From the Department of business administration because in future i want to see myself as a successful human resource manager. I choose IUBAT because the tuition fees is comparatibly less but the environment is totally designed for learning. Each and every faculty of BBA department has a foreign degree. Transportation and disciplines are also good.   In IUBAT we have no air condition system. The transportation route should also be broaden.   The timing is strictly maintained. 1st term, mid term and final exm has fixed time span also the result date and the starting date of class and all other timing is perfect. Admission test is not taken strictly. All of our faculty should judge our talent properly.  Our university is perfect in one word. "
"good,they work very hard for us and so we are very lucky to have such nice teachers and also friends."
"before coming to lpu i thought sports were very good n encouraging.but, there are many politics in sports especially in cricket."
"everything was good regarding to university but, some lecturers don't have grip on the subject and lag in the teaching"
It has a very poor educational system and so we do not want to study here and also we find it boring
All is good  in our university and so we enjoy a lot here and also can spend quality time
time is not sufficient and so we face a lot of problems in dealing with situations
the staff is highly punctual ad interactive and encourage the students to participate in the class
exam pattern is good and marks distribution is also good but paper checking is too hard
My department is very good and I like my university so much because it helps me in a lot of ways to remain motivated .
library is providing excellent facilities and as a result we feel very lucky to enjoy all of these facilities
"Pharmacy is my department as it is a multidisciplinary subject. Reputation of this in the job sector is high . It has proper facilities, Companionship and also Political environment has better facilities. The facilities that are  provided aren't satisfactory. It is Good but need improvement"
"CSE department is my department. I'm in this department because I love computer science.  Fees and Facilities,  Grading and Campus Facilities, Lab Facilities Grading System and Advising System Expected is fine. I have a Good CGPA but  not satisfied I badly need a campus. "
My department is Microbiology because this subject has always fascinated me. MNS dept is the strongest in brac.There is no campus. No sufficient space. Nothing is fine. But still I love my university. 
staff is showing partiality between north indians and south indians which is a great problem because  discrimation prevails here
Awesome in a word and so I like my university and am glad to study here
This university is number 1 in terms of extracurricular activities and in encouraging students to participate at their comfort levels.
University in Bangladesh has lack of  security and so we feel very much unsecured
good and ample number of extracurricular activities take place and we enjoy a lot here
review of my university is overall good and which is why I love to study here
"library is very well managed and provide needed facilities to us. So, we are very proud of it"
"I study in Brac University and my department is Cse. because of i am interested in it sector.  The cost is increasing day by day, but their services and study quality is not sufficient and enough."
All are good except paper checking. It should be improved for the betterment of the university
Again the university tests students of their ability to memorize stuff. Questions should emphasize more on concepts rather than testing brain's cramming storage house.
No facilities for a student to work on his/her potential. Education quality is questionable. Teachers quality are dropping exponentially.University kills creativity and makes everyone think alike. No thinking outside the box because they have a curriculum to follow
"Good, but there should be at least  a practical subject in every semester so that students can improve practically"
 only good thing in this university is that it is near my house and so it takes less time to reach 
 the faculties are knowledgebale and helps us interacting with other students which is why I love them
all are excellent and so I like my university a lot and I am studying in the best university
Facilities and fees of Brac and NSU is high but is very costly and so only rich people gets admitted here
"I chose EEE for it's Fame. More students are admitted  than the capacity. Teachers are very strict so not satisfied,"
"I study in NORTH SOUTH UNIVERSITY in  Marketing Department. It has Good faculty members, Great campus environment, quality education. It is   first university in Bangladesh to receive ACBSP accreditation   .  Nepotism in advising  is seem. In some cases satisfied,  in very few cases not satisfied . Most of them were very much supportive. The administration should be more supportive towards the students    "
I am from CSE department and I am not satisfied and so I do not like my university 
I am from BBA department and I am satisfied in every possible ways with my university
My subject is CSE and I find it is very hard and my university cannot give proper knowledge
Teachers are supposed to let the students know the actual use of the instruments used in the lab.
It is excellent and also very interesting to study in my university as it is the best of all
examination including exam pattern is good in some ways.MCQs should be given to students for the preparation of exams.
Library is vast and has got wide variety of books . But I think more number of specimen copies of books should be made available
Outstanding in a word and so I love my university a lot and want to graduate from here
The library has insufficent number of books for all the students and so for this reason people visit the library so much
books are less in the library and it is a problem because all students cannot afford buying books so library is the only option for them
"I study BBA at Finance.  Actually i want to do the job in a Bank  .   I chose nsu for education quality.  Actually I  dont have any major problem.  But faces some little problem like the IT department is not more concern for their services  . It has the Best Faculty and Best Education system.  Sometimes the authorities dont care about our extra services Like wifi and others.    I want best education, well communication and make my skills.    We need a friendly environment for education "
Lab work is properly covered in the labs by the faculty and evaluations help to learn more practical knowledge in depth.
No permanent campus and so I hate to study here because it is very crowdy
"good but there is more need of keeping books of general topics about social,politics , gk and other than related to subject so that we will get some knowledge about country related issues."
The university consists of a whole world in itself.It is diverse and manages to conduct all events properly.I love being the part of this university where we get equal and all opportunities in all respects and fields.
unbiased so it is great and for this reason we hate to study here 
"Discipline, punctuality , lecture delivery all are good but needs to do some work for quality of lecture"
"Awesome, peaceful and relaxing atmosphere is found which is a pleasure "
Sometimes systems at labs are screwed up .Otherwise everything is at their respected desk.
extracurricular activities are excellent and provides best platform to students.
Some of the teachers are not well experienced but they are interactive and helpful and punctual.
Very poor resource to teach student I hate my university. Nothing to say. I don't want to tell about their problems here
Fix the overcrowding situation  so that we can study here peacefully
"UIU is my university and I STUDY ENVIRONMENT. It has the Best Faculty.TOO MUCH STRIKE FOR MARKING.IF YOU are  SERIOUS ABOUT STUDY, YOU NEED TO ADMIT in this university OR JUST AVOID IT because it is Too much strict"
Practical work is fair so more and more lab works should be assigned
IT IS ALSO GOOD and interesting and so I like to study here an love to be here
Average in a word. Nothing special because I find other universities better
We don't get answers key and even the question papers for our mcq exams.There should be some means by which we could recheck our answers and get to know what mistakes we have made.
extracurricular activities are good. And so I like this university
 Average 3.5/5 and for this reason it is an average university with normal courses
Average in a word and opportunities are less here which is an issue
"ECE is my department .It’s my  passion. It has the  Best Education system . Online system is too much bad.  Almost satisfied.   For teacher, I will give them 9.5 out of 10.
For facilities, I Will give    them 7 out of 10.Nothing "
not every one is getting opportunities here only recommended students getting.
They are very co-operative and helpful and also friendly and so I love them
BRAC UNIVERSITY CSE is where I study. Enthusiastic in computer science . The environment and Administration is Too much secured To make some places for the students for roaming and I think it is essential.It is Very much intimate and providing enough facilities. Faculties should be open-minded for the students.
CSE is my department because I love coding.I got my preffered subject. There is no space in the university.The Girls are 10/10. The space isnt enough. I expect more oportunities should be provided by the university . Overall my university is not that bad.
Its nice to tell that I have no complains about my university. And so far it is the best
All the faculties are doing there job well and so I love them
every one can tell depth of course but most of them only give notes
"CSE is my department and  I chose it because my passion is in coding. There is no campus, too much pressure in 4months(actually 3months) semester . Full syllabus in final is very much hectic so the syllabus should only be the contents that will be taught after mid."
All the activities are good and appropriate for students and so for this reason I love my university
HAVE TO IMPROVE  the condition and also the administration of the university for the betterment
some teachers aren't doing their jobs in a well manner and so it is a problem for the students
My university is doing a great job I think in maintenance  and so far I am loving it
lab and practical work are  good in a way and I love it so much 
"University is very good at delivering proper lectures,also the interaction with students is descent. Sometimes the teachers lack in terms of punctuality but overall university is giving a good input."
good facilities are provided in my university and I am proud of it
practical work provides detailed knowledge of theoretical work
I think the university is doing just fine and also it is the best of all
duration of issuing books from library should be changed from 1week to 2 week and that would be great.
My opinion about my university is that I feel that my university is the best among all the others
I study in the best University because it provides me a lot of facilities
Everything is fine and if this continues then I can graduate with a good CGPA
Our University is  upto the mark and it is the best among all others
"EEE is my department. I chose this subject to persue a career in energy and machinery. Also the Achivements, facilitiesand  reputation is high. It is a great place to chill and study. Teacher and university should encourage more to do research and projects."
I like the question pattern and find it interesting in a way and also exciting
The examination pattern is good .But time is not sufficient for those questions.
"Not good because in lab, teachers donot teach us how to work on live projects or how to make a live project. So i have observed that whatever teachers have been teachig us in lab that will not be useful in our future life."
"CSESubject Not having proper campus, too much student, labs needs improvement Most faculties are good Not enough space , noisy , huge lift loneMaking a good environment for study Most teachers are good enough but facilities needs improvement "
No I hate my university and do not want to study here . It is the worst
I study in CSE because its my passion . There is no campus to breath.Its educational curriculum is great but this University takes more students than its capacity every semester. I thought University will guide me in the right path. So far I am satisfied to study here.
I like this very much because every subject is linked up with real life situations and every thing in the subject is useful
Everything is going fine in lab . I am learning new things which is good for us
"CSE is my department . I feel pressure is a bit much but I think it's for our own good because it has great facilities like st,consultation. But we don't have a permanent campus which is a problem"
According to me everything is going well in accordance to interaction.More than enough is served.
"our university is good in punctuality,lecture delivery but it is not good in terms of interaction"
exam pattern and marks distribution are good and so I love it so much
BRAC UNIVERSITY is my university and my suject is CSE because I like to do programming. Education quality is good. Residential semester is also fun.Lack of space in campus is a problem for Learning more practical knowledge in my field.I could not fulfill this by studying there.They were well qualified and the facilities were enough.
No permanent campus and so I hate to study here because it is very crowdy. No space is found so I do not like it
extracurricular activities held in university are necessary because it provides student a platform where they can improve and groom them.
It is proper to have extracurricular activities and very much intersting and also exciting
teaching is good but some lecturers are showing partiality between south people and north people
"BRAC UNIVERSITY is my University. I study in Comuper Science and Engineering because I was good at mathematics.The Residential Semester is not having a campus of its own and cramming too many students in there.It has An encouraging study environment . Though it deteriorated in the later period of my study.Thereis no campus It does not have a good administration, and other student facilities. The faculties  are not that satisfactory.Some were pretty good. Especially at the early stage of my study at the university. But the rest were not up to mark.Some were pretty good. Especially at the early stage of my study at the university. But the rest were not up to mark."
BRAC UNIVERSITY is my university and I chose CSE for coding. I expected to learn much more but lecturers did not help enough.
EXTRAORDINARY in a way because it is the best and also extracurricular activites are provided here
all the books are easily available and accessable and the limit of book issued need to be increased
"CSE is my department.  I've been looking forward to studying computers since a very early age.BRACU has been making their name and fame for quite a few years. I looked around, asked a bunch of seniors, took advice from a relative who's a CSE-related job holder abroad and researched the base alumni situation of the university and also the interview board preferences.The only primary problem that comes to mind right now is the unavailability of a permanent campus. There are way too many students enrolled but not enough space.The studying environment, CSE-faculty and the lecturers' cooperative attitude, the clubing experience, the facilities.My expectations are not being satisfied as I expect the university to care about their students, and by enrolling too many students, they are not giving much attention to the ongoing space-problem.There are Helpful and  knowledgable people (at least the older ones)."
BBA is my department and I am satisfied with my subject and I also love it
"AIUB is my university and I study in CSE because this is the age of technology and it helped most to touch the deep .Unwanted pressure and their teaching environment .Too much concern about study and students careers.Authorities are 110% Business minded and the Teaching style ,environment,faculties everything was up to mark except the over business minded steps of authority .Overall this is one of the nice places to learn.Teachers were damn. Every one had 2 faces one soft and friendly ,other was too rude. At exam hall and attendance issues i found there other face.Teachers were damn. Every one had two faces one soft and friendly ,other was too rude. At exam hall and attendance issues i found there other face."
content is very knowledgable and gives us huge knowledge of every subject
There is good evaluations in lab regarding practical and so far I like it
"depth of the course are depended on the level of student intake, course material is delivered after the class in UMS"
"Library facilities are good, it maintains silence there and makes good environment to study but sometimes it goes very strict which is not required according to me."
I am satisfied because I earned a lot of knowedge and  it has proper course material
Cse is my subject because I couldn't get admit to my desired university .Everything from education to food facility is disorganized.It has no place to sit. We need more rest.We are paying a lot of money atlest we dont deserve a fresh graduate as a faculty. We need experienced teachers who can teach well those type of faculties should be our faculty instead of moody fresh graduates. I only had 3 good teachers in my 4years of education. . Ish..dzk and saiful sir...other than them I dont want to comment 
the labs are not practically built and which becomes and issue for the students
good delivery of lectures in time and its is very helpful for the students
We have a good library with all facilities which is why all the students are happy
"A lot could be done to improve the environment around the campus (especially public universities). 
Quality of education is degrading. Education is fine because of it's reputation but needs to work on the infrastructure. "
Punctuality is good. Most of the teachers are not interacting with students .
"According to me students are doing lab only for marks . So, it is pointless because they do not learn anything"
"interaction of some faculty was good but not all faculty.So, it is a problem."
the content of the course is knowledgeable and also very interesting
I study in Department of EEE. I was interested in the subject. It's known for a good . There's no space in our department . It is extremely crowded. There's no campus. The buildings are very risky with the lifts. Nothing comes to my mind . The grading system is very bad.  Insufficient Faculty is seen.Already the university is crowded but still they are taking more students every semester. The transportation system of the university should be improved 
"That is  good but the problm is whenever in university the functions like one india, one world are held we are not alowed to go because we have to attend the classes and if we miss the classes we will have to loose the attendence and everyone knows in that attendance is very important. "
"CGPA is not the only method of judgement for  reputation.  Too many students study here. No campus .At least some courses should be offered based on the current demands. No, the requirements are not met. Only the basics are taught . The university really should stop admitting so many students in one subject"
Lab evaluations are good. And so far we are enjoying the labs and find it interesting
I was a student of IBA - DU (There was no way of specifying this in the first option)
I do not participate in any programs so I am bored and do not like any of the programs
lecture delivery is not so good and so students face a lot of problems in studying
"ECE is the subject that I study. Money oriented oppression towards students is seen . Faculties are not good and a lot of prssure is given to students. Pressure makes me strong.Bad lab facilities and also there is no inside smoking zone, no wifi. Nation wise we have to start practising ethics"
I study in department of EconomicsI . No specific reason for chosoing this subject.  The university discipline is too restrictive. The course curriculum has excessive pressure on unnecessary stuffs.  I expect the university to be a lot more open to freedom and currently it is not being satisfied. The faculties are quite helpful
Cse  is mysubject and I study in the best university for Cse Subject .It has a good syllabus and my university has a secured system and for which I feel safe to study here.
I hate my University. It is not good at all and so for this reason I do not want to study here.
It's appreciable (MOURI)

Labs helps to know how the work is done.It thought me a good lessons.
"The university is good but it also has a long way to go. More teachers should have their PhD and college fests related to academic curriculum must be improved to a great extent and must be managed properly.The interaction is good, lecture delivery needs more lucidity. The punctuality is top notch."
IP is provided to the students which is very helpful for the students.
Very good teaching and management but too much load on student and working hours
"CSE since its demandingReputation, quality of education, faculties, distance from my residence and because I was offered handsome percentage as scholarshipOver crowded, lack of recreation, lack of lab facilities and I feel overall the quality of education has dropped considerablyIt has a recognition world wideLiterally everything because of the problems in the university and the faculties are less approahable now a days, they hardly want to help studentsI expected to learn about different prospective, explore opportunities, univerities should train us for industry but I feel we r just buying a degree.

I always find myself charmed with the informations that how microorganisms are so much related to our bodies and lifes though we can't feel them until we get infection. So I choose this department to know more about the biological science.By their stranded level of education policiesOf course the 1st problem of BRAC University as everyone knows is very small campus with a over population. The system of teachingI really don't like such a small place with so much sound pollution. I hardly find any place there to sit and to have some times for study not even in library.I just need our new campus so soon and that's all.It's a 50/50 thoughIf possible make a foot over bridge between the 2 buildings. We the students really suffer a lot including the guards who try to help the students to cross the roads safely to cross the road as local buses are always there and we all know how unsafe it is"

The campus, the security, student facility, the environment.There’s no specific thing that I dislike about my university.I would like to graduate without any academic issues and I expect my university will be helpful towards me about ensuring me my certificates on time. There are students who have faced some issues during collecting their certificates that is why I’m not sure whether I will face any difficulties or not.I would say the teachers are very helpful and cooperative. But some of them are biased which is problem."

Brac university cse was the next best option amongst private universities. Brac the ngo in itself is something I admired and wanted to be a part of.Not having a permanent campus is one of the major problems. In my opinion campus provides a better learning environment and also the hassle of moving from one side of the road to the other for class wouldn't be an issue then. Residential semester. If you are willing to learn certain elements that's crucial for a discipline and healthy lifestyle, residential semester can teach a lot of it. I think every university should have such a semester or two.Lack of a permanent campusI expect promises to be kept. I expect them to listen to the students and back them up in certain cases which might be a little controversial, but they should be assertive than being diplomatic.Not much to complain, good enoughNope"

First of all, too many students are being admitted, stretching beyond the limit. This is deteriorating the university life for the students. The campus is crammed up all the time. Secondly, the quality of the students is quite low which is mainly due to a poor admission process.Campus and the teaching stuffs. I have come across some of the best teachers, who have taught me many things. Poor admission process, Poor administration, Poor internet, Poor computer labs,.....My expectation is that the authority would be kind enough to listen to the problems of the students and come to a reasonable solution. After all, it's the students who are suffering. No, they are not being satisfied.As I said earlier, I have come across some of the best teachers in my life and I consider myself lucky to have known them, even if it is for a little while."

"Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) : Because I enjoy this course as well as I want to be a video game developer in future.I have received good reviews of CSE department and its courses that it is the best place to study for CSE with great faculties. Other than that, overall performance, environment and students interaction and activities with each other and of this University.Fees is very high. Agreed that we are given consultation hours, tutorial classes and all those extra help. Yet that's really too much and this money increases like for spring 2018 batch if suppose it is 85K, for summer 2018 it will probably rise to around 90K. So, money increases semester wise. Another huge problem is during the time of pre-advising & advising. In the time of pre-advising during our first 6 semesters specially, we could not always get our desired courses on desired time and even desired faculties from whom to study. We always had to compensate on one or two factors. There were limited seats & sections for an ample amount of students. Even time would clash with lab or other subjects which we have to fix and it takes huge time since seats get booked & adding or dropping courses sometimes take time because the survey gets hanged as well in both cases. I think this will continue later as well. In addition to that, if our pre-advising is not completed & we move to advising, we have to stand for hours since student to faculty ratio lets say only for CSE is 200:1 which results in slower server (server slows down in both cases of pre-advising and advising)Interacting students and helpful faculties, really good friends, enjoy classes, enjoy this course and useful workshops for my career related and club fairs, sometimes good food from outside all these are the best. Good time in TARC, Savar too.Too much chaos of students every where and hardly any place to sit during free times especially in canteensCurrently, I am satisfied since my expectations as of now are having great workshops related to my career apart from good studies.  Very GoodNo not really. Thank You for counting my review in advance & welcome as well."

"CSE department and choose this field of area when I first started coding and find it interesting. Achievement and reputation and education quality that's in the air Space , falling education quality, bad faculty recruitment"
Extra curricular activities also help students to divert their mind from their study for some time. University plays an important role in this task.
all the given terms are good regarding the university

labs are good but experiments are not very informative
"CSE
More job opportunitiesConsidered one of the best for studying CSE among the private universities. Due to the open credit system, we often end up having classes 6 days a week, up to 6:30 pm. The trimester system also makes everything very hectic as there is a huge syllabus to cover in a very short time and you often don't learn the topics as well as you'd like to. We also don't get proper semester breaks; we only get a few days off before the next semester starts again.1. The faculties; majority of them are very qualified and incredibly helpful
2. The strong policies against bullying and sexual harrassment and sexismWe don't have a proper campus.I expect to get the most help in learning which I do. I also expect a proper campus which we aren't getting.Majority of the teachers are very helpful and understanding. We have many resources around the campus like the many computer labs, library, study rooms, reading rooms for any kind of help. The system of having student tutors to help us when the faculties aren't available is also very helpful."
This is really a good thing that events happen in our university regularly but they must be announced early so that every student can prepare themselves for participation because sometimes we get to know about most of the events when they have already been conducted. So announcement must be there.

Just for some unfortunate reasons, could got a chance of admission in a public University. Why does the reality had to be so painful and depressing. Life has turned into a joke. That's all I had to share. By the way, good luck with your survey."
Practical work is in interesting but different teachers evaluate in their own way. Some of the teachers in some section give marks without taking viva and some does not give marks accordingly
They are sportive

Quite a lot of events are organized and students have a all round growth which is a nice thing.
I don't like the -ve marking system. appart from that everything is great
quite good
not much good
They need to improve education qualities and make it more practical in a way that students can imply in their livesI'm not in a university. But from a medical student perspective I can say is it would be great to have a bigger campus and a bit more relaxing 
practical work including evaluations are good so that students can learn about practicals.
"Psychology. Based on current demand and future opportunities. Fees, convenience, renowned acclaimed,   Transportation, Dorm rent, Systematic pre-planned governance of the university, where students don't face any hassle.

This is not being satisfied to the extend i expect them do so. They are friendly, helpful, and care-giving. "

practicals are good but evaluations are not because they don't give enough time to work
Till now the universities of Bangladesh need improvements in both academic and non-academic criteria Providing standard and quality education among students but the cost is so high

ALL PRACTICAL WORK IS GOOD
Knowledge is maximum gained by reading books and also teachers explain the concept in depth.
the level of examination should be raised. Questions with reasoning must be included

"CSE. I was just going with the flow of taking CSE as a discipline.BRACU has a popularity. So I came BRACU for that.Less space with more students. So it is difficult to have a seat in cafeteria or library.Some of the faculties are top class. I think this is a very good thing.Authority is too much strict sometimes.I expect to learn. But like other educational institutions of Bangladesh, they are not so helpful in practical learning. Here we learn more about theories.Overall they are ok."
It's good but we don't get sufficient time for participating in that activities
The depth of course is very much deep. According to me its very essential
"Bachelor's of Science in Biochemistry & Biotechnology. 
Because I love biology and there is a future demand in this filed , and has scopes for independent research. Because of the subject , achievements , facilities and good international relations. It is very expensive. Most of the classes are digitized and faculties are very helpful Grading system is very strict and toughI currently am in my first semester, so can't say yet. Good"
Interaction is good but it should b more ...rest is too perfect
interaction is good but not with mostly male lecturers.punctuality is maintained by everyone but lecture delivery not peak quality.
library has huge collection of books from different authors
lab improves practical knowledge

"EEE. I was fascinated by engineering machines and stuffs so I chose EEE. The faculty and also the achievements of the university was good I heard so I picked that institute. The lack of a good campus is always there in out mind. Some times one need to rest and relax from study but university had failed to provide us that. The ethics and the people are extremely polite. The 3 semester system in a year is disturbing that what I think. Because of that I get more quizzes, less combined vacations. The faculty will be moderate about the marking and the scholarship systems should be upgraded. The faculty are much much liberal but there are always some flaws. "
