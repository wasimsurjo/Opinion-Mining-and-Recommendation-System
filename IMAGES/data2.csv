review
"The library should be the strength of a university. It is awesome that we have this perfectly. we can really learn practically. However, we lack open space and also a relaxing place also."
Every semester the universities are increasing fees. This has gone beyond our affordability to pay.
IT IS VERY MUCH USEFUL AND WE CAN PARTICIPATE IN OUR INTERESTS
Education system should be more delevoped like world's other university. Too many students is for no good. 
My department is CSE. The authority doesn't care about how the people study. It only cares about getting money. The facilities are not up to the mark. I want my university to improve more.
We are facing a lot of problems regarding the high amount of tuition fees so we need a scholarship waiver for handling this problem.
duration of issuing books from library should be changed from 1week to 2 week and that would be great.
I am from Architecture department. Cost of education is too much and temporary campus is a problem. There are good as well as poor faculties.
Need scholarships to complete my study in the middle of graduation. 
"I wanted to be a developer. Reputation, Lack of campus. Out of date curriculum. Recent drives to modernize Slow administration. Horrible IT support. Student first policies. Not satisfied yet."
My university has a Lot of activities and students get exposure in games.
"Very good indeed to be in a place where there is no politics, no ragging and women can move freely as they please."
I study in department of EconomicsI . No specific reason for chosoing this subject.  The university discipline is too restrictive. The course curriculum has excessive pressure on unnecessary stuffs.  I expect the university to be a lot more open to freedom and currently it is not being satisfied. The faculties are quite helpful
The labs are the best part of being in a private university.
"The thing that matters most to me is achieving good grades. Feedback is provided with all work both academic and practical, and the option is always there to speak with the marker personally as well. I want the sense of getting students ready for the 'real world' to continue and improve."
Lab evaluations are good. And so far we are enjoying the labs and find it interesting
"That is  good but the problm is whenever in university the functions like one india, one world are held we are not alowed to go because we have to attend the classes and if we miss the classes we will have to loose the attendence and everyone knows in that attendance is very important. "
"waste ,library is not the good place to study.I am in my final year, and I can safely say that joining pearson has been the biggest regret of my life. Not to mention the cost of the mistake. I do not recommend you join this university"
Having hostle facilities would make life much more comfortable for students coming from relatively longer distance.
IT IS ALSO GOOD and interesting and so I like to study here an love to be here
Descency is absent. People stare at us like we're something to eat.  I feel like I'm in a zoo. I believe private universities are not like this.
"School of Law. Always wanted to be a lawyer. Best private university for LawNo campus The Brand itself studying in buildings. Feels like coaching centre Campus Campus Campus Teachers - 50 50 
Facilities - 40/100 Good luck"
I hate my University. It is not good at all and so for this reason I do not want to study here.
Our exam pattern of Unversity is very nice but paper checking is not at all good. sometimes evaluation is not good.
Majoring Economics. I love studying Economics. BRAC University need campus of their own.
"BBA is good and professional. lot of opportunities to do internship , make creative decisions and to try our desired ields."
Examination in private universties are a pain in the neck. The examination patterns can be changed.
"In private universities we often find a very rough class timings and too many assignments, which hampers our study."
"As compared to other colleges and universities,  our university is perfect in all the aspects."
"Sometimes study burden is so  much that we can not participate in other activities .Therefore, one activity should be made complusory for every student like all other courses."
Study is appreciable for Public University as they have big campus and all facilities.
EXAM PATTERN IS GOOD AND MARKS DISTRIBUTION IS ALSO GOOD AND PAPER CHECKING IS VERY HARD.
I think that the scholarship waiver is very necessary for me inorder to complete my graduation succesfully.
exam pattern is very good but if you give question papers to students it is helpful. also there is issues with food. there should be a place for us to eat
"CSE in major field in BRAC University.
More job opportunities. Considered one of the best for studying CSE among the private universities. Due to the open credit system, we often end up having classes 6 days a week, up to 6:30 pm. The trimester system also makes everything very hectic as there is a huge syllabus to cover in a very short time and you often don't learn the topics as well as you'd like to. We also don't get proper semester breaks; we only get a few days off before the next semester starts again. 1. The faculties; majority of them are very qualified and incredibly helpful.
2. The strong policies against bullying and sexual harrassment and sexism. We don't have a proper campus. I expect to get the most help in learning which I do. I also expect a proper campus which we aren't getting. Majority of the faculties are very helpful and understanding. We have many resources around the campus like the many computer labs, library, study rooms, reading rooms for any kind of help. The system of having student tutors to help us when the faculties aren't available is also very helpful."
Need scholarships to make my graduation hassel free
"English and Humanities because BRACU is one of the top Private Universities in BD..No campus, bad grading criteria. Nothing is better than our club facilities. Everything (mostly grading system)Not satisfied with rules outside the the university buildings"
"i am from CSE Department. Because I love coding.subject. Campus is insufficient, lack of seats in sections, messed up advising. The department requires High amount of fees. Not satisfied. Must have a proper campus. Great!"
Well and Good only if the faculties are willing to help which doesn't happen actually.
Our University's Education system is Average standard. Faculties are Good standard
Education system is good. The tuition fees are very high. The retake courses fees should be made lesser.
"Studying CSE. Technology intrigues me. Among all the university admission test, BRAC University was the only one where I got my preferred subject. As there are lots of student. During the Pre-Advising & Adviasing everything becomes chaos. Best faculties. The old cafe was much better than the new one. I still don't know what to expect but so far i am enjoying it here. System is the best. Maybe because I got the chance to attend the classes of some of the best lecturers here. I actually started to enjoy studies."
"TARC experience was awesome as an university thing.It taught me so many things and most importantly , gave me a chance to see my limits."
CSE is my subject.Proper Practical Education is needed.Student are Friendly.We have no campus.Satisfied Former Alumni
There are many good and qualified faculties but few lacks in interaction with students and fails to describe a topic.
lecture delivery is not so good and so students face a lot of problems in studying
"Very bad experience. Course treated, handled and organised poorly"
"I study Environmental Science. To know,explore and preserve the nature. To get closer to my purpose.Subject,achievements and facilities are most important.No one Connects us with the outter world.Our university Helds workshop seminars etc."
the staff is highly punctual ad interactive and encourage the students to participate in the class
All books are not available in the library. The library needs to be improved.
"University with best campus is the best. Without a campus, a University has no value."
Mid term percentage should be increased. So that students get more choice to get success in the examinations.
"I am from BRAC UNIVERSITY and from the department of EEE, because i wanted to work in powerplants and wanted to work with engines and turbines specially i got nothing special TARC Campus, contents of courses is Good and favorable Campus but I was not satisfied with it. I was expecting more realistic engineering contents from the courses which was not met. Our Faculties were highly qualified."
No I hate my university and do not want to study here . It is the worst
Me with my friends miss classes for lacking of transport service when we needed transport services.
Universiy facilities not good enough. we want something more. WE need good labs and equipments. We need people who can motivate us to be more creative.
All the facilities provided by the university administration is good.
yeah its obviously good that you have a university where you can do as you please and you are safe. You are not a lab rat of the seniors.
"The online system in library usually does not work , so it creates a problem for us to issue books."
Got admitted due to Family opinion. all in short time so lengthy syllabus very helpful excessive tuition fees be a good human being also a good engineer.
"I am from the department of cse and engineering. I have chosen to get into this department because I am interested to work with Artificial Intelligence .Mainly we face  accommodation problem for not having a true campus. The academic exellency being resourceful.Intake of mass number of students every semester is a problem. My expectations are to have a bigger campus along with some facilities to be improved.  So far some of the aspects have been addressed. Most of the faculties are really knowledgeable, freindly and helpful beyond class time. "
I am studying Physics in Chittagong University. Lectures helps  us in clear our concept over any topic. 
If they can provide me with scholarship then I think that I will be very much happy.
I will get admitted in NORTH SOUTH UNIVERSITY in Finance.The reason is this department seems challenging to me..The tuition fee is too high however I will be spendind this money due to their quality education. At the end where ever I get admitted I have to hork hard and be very persistant.
I cannot attend my class on time because of the lackings of a proper transportation system.
Clubing activies in unversity  seems to me a very good system since it is a good source of interaction with other and to built a leadership quilities and to overcome our faults.
"Most of the private universities do not have proper hostle facilities. Many students are from out of the city, living without their parents. Arranging hostel facilities would make thier life much more easier."
Library facilities are good for students. This is most important for students.
"I am from CSE. I like CSE because of better job prospect.I look into an university's Achievement.We have a Very bad campus and overcrowded, we have to cross roads to get to university buildings.We have Very good faculties, some peers are very active a few administrative offices contribute a lot towards a better university.The main problems are No parmanent  Campus, no place for recreation, extremely easy admission test, overcrowded and quality of my peers(very low not all). The positive part is Good education but sometimes our topics seems to be too easy so I might be unprepared for the future. Residential semester is the best part."
Fix the overcrowding situation  so that we can study here peacefully
I did never visited the library of my university so I am unable to share my experience.
I am from BBA department. The best best thing about my unversity is quality of education and clubing activities. The teaches are very friendly.
sometimes proper course material is not required. the public have more standards than the private
"My elder brother is a graduate from BRACU. And since I didn't get into a public university's desired department I opted for BRAC's CSE dept. Because I actually was interested to learn about how everything worked. Shortage of breathing space. Too many people. Open credited major system but people not getting their desired courses or times due to overpopulation. My friends. No space to have the proper university life. My expectation is nothing but, space.And no. It's not. Top notch faculties. Everyone looks out for the best of the students. Not really. "
"Great experience it was. I was upset with a small campus but in the end, what mattered was being able to graduate peacefully without delays unlike in public."
The course notes are very knowledgeable and proper. But they really lack campus & security.
Every University's lab practicle must be of 2 hours. That's expected.
"i am from CSE. I guess somewhat due to the trend and probably this department will give me more job opportunities. I somewhat liked computers and CSE graduates do earn a hefty salary .Advertisements, reputation , SubjectThe university doesn't have proper available transportation system. Doesn't have a campus of it's own. Not enough facilities for extracurricular activities.The departmental Faculties are well qualified.Doesn't have a campus of it's own.Expected a good management system. A good course management system would be nice. The university should make more places for student activities.The Faculties are good and experienced.I think the university shouldn't be so hesitant and close-fisted in making changes for students so that they might have a better university life."
as per the exam pattern maths exam always have to be subjective rather than objective.
VERY NICE....BUT BOOKS ARE NOT AVAILABE EVERY TIME. also there is no transport system which should be a matter of concern
The lab evaluations are very strict which is good. Student wants good marking.
The examination pattern is good .But time is not sufficient for those questions.
"ECE is my department .It’s my  passion. It has the  Best Education system . Online system is too much bad.  Almost satisfied.   For teacher, I will give them 9.5 out of 10.
For facilities, I Will give    them 7 out of 10.Nothing "
Overall my university experience has been good. I felt welcomed upon arrival and continue to feel welcome. All queries are answered kindly and promptly. The accomation is situtated in a great location which allows me to maximise my university experience and have been paired with great flat mates
My department is mathematics and there is no space here which I do not like it at all.
"Computer science and engineering at BRAC University.
I choosed this subject cause I love tech and I want to know more about them. We don't have proper campus yet. Not satisfied yet
a campus would be satisfying. Some are angels and on the other hand some are demons."
Lack of faciliies in the universiy and so for this students face many problems in studying here.
"I am from BRAC UNIVERSITY,CSE. Good Teachers Matter, Some faculties are good , some of them bad."
CSE is the future and CSE is amazing in this university. It motivates us to enter contests and so they're awesome
"University is very good at delivering proper lectures,also the interaction with students is descent. Sometimes the faculties lack in terms of punctuality but overall university is giving a good input."
Studying in public university is prastigious. Getting chance in any public university is not a cup of tea.
"Pharmacy is my department as it is a multidisciplinary subject. Reputation of this in the job sector is high . It has proper facilities, Companionship and also Political environment has better facilities. The facilities that are  provided aren't satisfactory. It is Good but need improvement"
The whole education system of our university doesn't seem satisfactory to me.
All the extra curricular are so good. University is providing many pathways to many students apart from education system in Bangladesh. I study at Dhaka University.
"BRAC UNIVERSITY BBA, because marketing fascinates me. I can't find any exceptional facility to tell. Residential semester brings no differences in our life. No proper campus. Teaching was not up to the standard i expected. Moderate everything."
"There is not enough security presence in or around the campus premise .Since the campuses are mostly situated in densely populated area surrounded by other instition, often unfortunate events take place."
"I study CSE. Since its demanding Reputation, quality of education, faculties, distance from my residence and because I was offered handsome percentage as scholarship over crowded, lack of recreation, lack of lab facilities and I feel overall the quality of education has dropped considerably. It has a recognition world wide. Literally everything because of the problems in the university and the faculties are less approahable now a days, they hardly want to help students. I expected to learn about different prospective, explore opportunities, univerities should train us for industry but I feel we r just buying a degree. I can learn more and better things in youtube than from university course and the faculties Lab facilities are horrible, faculties are good overall. However, they are reluctant to help students. "
"After this financial meltdown during COVID-19 pandemic, all fees must be reduced so that everyone can continue with their studies."
"In private universities they provide us with good lab faculities, which is very important as it gives us proper practical experience"
I am from NORTH SOUTH UNIVERSITY and my Department of Biochemistry & Microbiology. I am interested to study about life sciences.Department of Biochemistry & Microbiology. I am interested to study about life sciences.It has a brand value in BD job market.Too many to list down. I expected better laboratory facilities which wasn’t satisfactory in NSUMost of them were good faculties. Most of them were good faculties.
Private University are only after our money. The quality of education in terms of the money provided is absurd.
"BRAC UNIVERSITYCSECSEStandardQuality educationTheir policies are damn too weird. They hardly think about student when they never forget their business purpose. Not at all! Before getting admitted in 2015, I heard about the proper campus! We really wanted to see that! Student wants memories!  Unfortunately we do not have any memory related to campus! That's why we miss TARC the most. We must be given a proper UNIVERSITY campus.          75% Wonderful , 20% need some improvement and 5% never deserves to be teacher.    75% Wonderful , 20% need some improvement and 5% never deserves to be teacher.    "
unbiased so it is great and for this reason we hate to study here 
Books are heavily outnumbered when compared to number of students this is the only problem with library.
"My department is CSE. I like coding. it is a  kind of riddles and obviously it has many fields. For example: Subject, achievements and facilities.  It feels like that it's just that day we got admitted and now we have mids. So obviously I am facing problem to keep pace with their speed.   Everything is fine other than the fees..Although I didn’t face that kind of problems yet but my friends face it. Back to back classes on other side of the roads is really exhausting and i have seen my friends to miss 20 min lectures despite running. My teacher of maths is the best. "
Architecture department in BUET is one of the best. They have many achievements. Give opportunity for research. Access restrictions. More friendly campus for student. 
University in Bangladesh must include international facilities.
"After completing graduation at BUET, i realize this institute is better than other university."
"The course content of my department is enough, we donot need more. Our lab activites are also satisfactory. We got a number of great faculties."
"BRAC UNIVERSITY EEE, Because my mother wanted EEE,  Only tarc apart from that nothing.Tarc. Everything from campus to the dept. Teachers leaving for masters every semester and many more issues. A good dept. with proper educational support from the faculties and the register office. "
CSE at BRAC University my way. Because I am passionate about it. No campus available. Environment is not satisfied. Teachers are good. Not all the facilities are being ensured. 
"Because of lectures, assignments and so on, we don't get time to participate outdoor activities. Don't have proper vacation."
The content of the course should be increased with the depth. Many departments don't look at it.
Students living in a distant place are not able to attend the class regular. So we need a comfortable transport system.
Our Educaton system is very good. We don't have Campus. Lab Activities are not good. Faculties are very friendly.
"Education quality is good but the system is bad.Again, quality good but system is not satisfying "
Exams are conducted upon the the basis of the revised chapters upto that point. Marks distribution is appropriate. Paper checking is good
"Our distance has become a problem. So, i need good tranportation system so that we do not face transportation issues."
"The content of the subjects are good but some faculties do not upload the powerpoints on time. So, we face a lot of problems."
It has a very poor educational system and so we do not want to study here and also we find it boring
"I really enjoy the open and inclusive atmosphere we have here on campus. Tutors are almost always available to chat, and all the staff I’ve met have helped me to feel supported and at ease"
Dhaka University lab improves practical knowledge. Like to study here.
"Subject,fees,reputation basis Dhaka University IBA, BUP, MIST Business or Engineering studies for future planning is good. Facaltiles are highly educated, well facilities and well education provided. "
Some subjects are good and predictable. Remaining courses are not satisfactory.
"Excellent exam pattern, paper checking in this university is easy. this keeps us motivated and wanna try to do better."
"Its the best thing i have seen in this university,albeit the behaviour of library staff is unprofessional at times. They are whimsically rude."
Extracurricular activities increases mental and physical abilities. We love BRAC University.
Grading system of the private University should be changed
most of the teacher don't even bother about the practical performed by students.They give marks just by seeing face or something like that.
Register office is not very helpful in BRAC University. No place to relax after completing a class.
"The teacher is good ,interaction between student and teacher is also good"
We have a verery good environment. it is a good oppurtunities to many students for learning new things.
We do not want to comments because it's frustrating. When you participiate you get reappear or backlog and no time is given for exam preparation. 
EEE is good in Brac university Onk problem Tarc Campus Help me to be a better human being 
I am studying at cse. The faculties of our department are good but we dont have a campus. that's the worst part of our university. There is not quite place for the students.Always full of people.
"how come there' scholarship for 3.7+. There should be scholarship for 3.0+. There is no internship, it's ridiculous."
I am studying in BRAC University. Some of the universities not conducted any extracurricular activities but in our university doing these. Which is good for our future. 
Scholarships should be ensured for most the sudents inorder to ensure affordable  education for all.
Such a high tuition fee demanding by private universities make the higher studies difficult for many potential students who are not financially that much solvent.
Sanitary Pad vending mechines must installed in all univerity buildings. This would make female students much for comfortable in the university campus.
"EXAM PAPER CHECKING IS VERY HARD ,REMAINING IS GOOD"
I don't think studying at North South university is good. They focused on other things rather than study.
some books are not available. So please provide
I cannot study in a good private university without scholarship.
I felt happy because BUET encourages our talents. We are now all  over in Bangladesh.
Syllabus isnt brief enough.library is awesome and rich
too many activities are conducted and student get ample amount of opportunities to participate
I am satisfied with the facilities but few books are limited of database distribution
All is good. no other university is so serious about the concept of practicals. It is very important tp gain practical knowledge instead of just seeking grades blindly.
They are very co-operative and helpful and also friendly and so I love them
Cse  is mysubject and I study in the best university for Cse Subject .It has a good syllabus and my university has a secured system and for which I feel safe to study here.
"Best Business School in Bangladesh is IBA.Strong alumni network and quality of studentsReputation in the job market Quality of Faculties Best quality education and preparing well for the corporate world - No and Yes respectively Most were average, some were good a few were exceptional Most were average, some were good a few were exceptionalI was a student of IBA - DU (There was no way of specifying this in the first option)"
"I am in my final year, and I can safely say that joining pearson has been the biggest regret of my life. Not to mention the cost of the mistake. I do not recommend you join this university, I wish someone had been honest with me before I joined and told me the truth of this place. If anyone is offered a bursary to join, everyone gets it, its just a marketing scheme used to ploy more students in with lower tuition fees but also receive less value for a lower cost of being there."
I was a student of IBA - DU (There was no way of specifying this in the first option)
I cannot provide such high fees to study here so scholarship is very much necessary for me.
Content of the courses is good but some courses need improvement. Course material is not upto the mark.
Its fine but it should focus more towards practical knowledge rather than content based. It would be helpful for us.
Intense and quite difficult as well as support is not available from tutors much because there is not much time to spend with the teacher
extracurricular activities held in university are necessary because it provides student a platform where they can improve and groom them.
Everything is fine other than the fees..Although I didn’t face that kind of problems yet but my friends face it. Back to back classes on other side of the roads is really exhausting and i have seen my friends to miss 20 min lectures despite running. My teacher of maths is the best. 
"CSE is my department . I feel pressure is a bit much but I think it's for our own good because it has great facilities like st,consultation. But we don't have a proper campus which is a problem"
The quality of faculties are good but it would be better if  the standard of Courses could be improved. 
Awful quality of education. Good Image Outside But A Mess In Reality.
"CSE due to Pressure from family. No real campus.  Wanted proper football playing field but the university doesn't really give any importance here. S for faculties, Some are nice. Some are not nice"
"My department is Cse.
Enough job opportunities is the reason why I had chosen it.  It does not provide a healthy environment for studying since the amout of students are increasing and the university is being crowded . "
we have a excellent librery facilities. Pretty large collection of books
The public transports are not safe for famale students. Seperate bus service for female students is needed to introduced.
Diversity in the university is the best. I'm satisfied With University Students. They're all friendly.
"I was just going with the flow of taking CSE at BRAC University as a discipline. BRACU has a popularity. So I came BRACU for that. Less space with more students. So it is difficult to have a seat in cafeteria or library. Some of the faculties are top class. I think this is a very good thing. Authority is too much strict sometimes. I expect to learn. But like other educational institutions of Bangladesh, they are not so helpful in practical learning. Here we learn more about theories. Overall they are ok."
"Majoring in CSE at Asia Pacific University. Achievement Parking, Club Room, elevator queue everything is good."
University has been enjoyable and lectures have been informative and engaging.
courses are also good .but lt of subjects in cse departments at 1st year it feels like burden upon us
Everything is going fine in lab . I am learning new things which is good for us
"For gettting proper education, students should have accomodation facilities with huge amount of scholarship."
Examination pattern is good but marks distribution very confusing. we also need value in the eye of the mass.
The university is good but give us a lot of pressure
Our University provides good platform to interested students by providing quality education through creating a learning Environment.
Required text books are not available to every student. students are not getting their desired courses
There are no sufficient lab equipments in the labs and the avilable equipments are also not perfect.
Evaluation method is good.But the content is more to write in file.
"i am in BBA because i like business.Standard of education is good.LESS space and Too much pressure and no good scholarship.Education HIGH FEES, NO SPACE."
"My major subject is CSE. Mostly to make my parents happy. Good Reputation. BRAC university is well known private university for Engineering. No proper campus no proper place for students to go after class. Too many students and no campus except buildings. Engineering Department is too harsh. Many courses are not necessary but yet we have to do it. Grading system too harsh for subjects like engineering. A proper campus, more knowledgeable faculties. We were promised a campus 4 years ago still not done but a proper campus will be there soon but we wont get the chance to do class there. Some faculties are exceptionally good and some cant teach at all. Library should be more helpful towards students."
The academic experience and the overall student experience have benefited my personal development hugely. I have access to fantastic facilities and good libraries.
I am from CSE department. Subject and achievements are most important for an university.  Not having a proper campus is a big problem. The university will help us to gather experience about further life and will help us to grow up our connections which can help us in our job life. the faculties are. Very friendly.
Libraries are well enriched but book issuing time should be increased for 2 weeks.
"It doesn’t matter to which university fate takes you, you have to be hardworking and persistent."
There is no transportation system from University. So using public transport makes our life risky
"IP is provided to the students which is very helpful for the students. BRAC, NSU, EWU, AUST and other Universities are advanced in it."
"The private universities are good ,Mostly everything  depends on the quality of teacher's knowledge and student's interest."
The courses available in the university have got a scope and the teaching of these courses goes on with the point of view of bringing out the best from the student by indulging them in different activities and projects.
It is proper to have extracurricular activities and very much intersting and also exciting
The amount to study in a private university where there is not a proper transport system is very costly.
University in Bangladesh must include international facilities & more empowerment.
"library is very well managed and provide needed facilities to us. So, we are very proud of it"
"English department BRAC made it's name among Universities and was one of the best Universities then and still is.Too much student enrolment and no campus of it's own.Prepares the students for the future.Only concentrates on institutional education. Certain study tours are important as well.The feel which an University should provide to it's students are done primarily through a campus. As of now there's no campus in BRAC.Very good.A University should also have hostels for the students. In the primary stage of a university student, it wastes much time to search for a place to live that too close to the University in Dhaka city. Which in many cases takes too much money for a middle class student's family. So, I think there should be hostels for the students."
"Interaction is very good,accurate supplement material is provided but recommendation of books is very poor,the change of a particular teacher after 3 months or a semester of same subject causes problems."
All courses material provide very good knowledge in depth. North South University is good.
Paying high amount tuition fee at once becomes a mental pressure for me. We need installment for tuition fee.
"Discipline, punctuality , lecture delivery all are good but needs to do some work for quality of lecture"
Education must be disseminated through action and everywhere. A graduate first learn to be humble and give accolades to the surrounding and environment
I got into BRAC UNIVERSITY BBA because I wanted to learn about business studies.Open credit system provides us flexibility and Residential Campus is the best part.I expected to learn about how to become a good businessman but they only taught us to be good management skills.The faculties are highly qualified.
Pharmacy is my favourite subject in BRAC University. Crowded place. Good teacher and quality teaching. Que in lift is quite hassel.
Brac University is good. It provides a great platform. Good Environment.
excellent ...they work hard..their way of teaching is also pretty good
The tuition fees are increasing day by day. Its becoming unaffordable for me
"CSE, wanted to learn about computersAchievementsCg komCampus naiEverythingNo expectationGoodNo"
BBA is my department and I am satisfied with my subject and I also love it
Our university need more funding. Worst campus in the entire planet. our Class Period is very long. its not satisfactory.
In my I found that there are many opportunities for students. its all upon students about how they utilize them.
Private universities helps in improving skills. Theyforce us to be creative and make changes in our patterns.
"teaching is ok but the interaction with the students need to improve, i mean they have to focus on dull students more than intelligents...."
In my university I have to face too much examinations. its very stressful. we don't get enough time for us.
"My overall college experience has been quite enjoyable. This is because, the staff are friendly, proffessional and understanding to any needs that you may have."
I am from BBA Department. Grading policy is hard. Faculty Administrative is not Good.
It is excellent and also very interesting to study in my university as it is the best of all
Long distance between home and university kills my valuable time. I missed assignment submission time last semester that's why.
it is difficult to understand experiment in 1 hour in the university. we also need value in the job market
lab evaluations are pretty good .they help us a lot.. we can actually learn stuff.
BBS department of BRAC University is very good. Campus of the BRAC University is Suffocated.
"I am from Bachelor of Business Administration. Reduced  Tution Fees,Facilities , Job related course, Scholarship System, Career related course must be introduced. More facilities and Try to Increase University campus.To ensure each student can get proper facilities and Environment.Faculty are good but facilities are poor. University is a place where students learn knowledge not education. Each University should ensure facilities,environment for students."
The education system of my university is very helpful. It makes me more knowledgeable for my future career.
"Day by day, universities cost grew up, bt their services and study quality is not sufficient and enough."
TEACHING QUALITY IS VERY HIGH BUT NEED TO TAKE DOWN SOME ACTIVITIES . NOISE POLLITION IN THE UNIVERSITY ALWAYS A BIG PROBLEM.
well and good infrastructure and have trending software in lab
"According to me students are doing lab only for marks . So, it is pointless because they do not learn anything"
practicals are pretty well.But better lab equpments would have made things better.
"Some lectures are excellent,but not everyone is good at giving lectures. Better faculties are required."
They should gradually start to follow the system of foreign universities to give us the best education My university has good students but what is missing is well equipped faculties in ebery department 
"Private universities are good but it also has a long way to go. More faculties should have their PhD and college fests related to academic curriculum must be improved to a great extent and must be managed properly.The interaction is good, lecture delivery needs more lucidity. The punctuality is top notch."
"I study BBA at Finance.  Actually i want to do the job in a Bank  .   I chose nsu for education quality.  Actually I  dont have any major problem.  But faces some little problem like the IT department is not more concern for their services  . It has the Best Faculty and Best Education system.  Sometimes the authorities dont care about our extra services Like wifi and others.    I want best education, well communication and make my skills.    We need a friendly environment for education "
"our university is good in punctuality,lecture delivery but it is not good in terms of interaction"
Some of the private university doesn't have transport system. Students have to care about it which waste too much time.
"CSE dept. Basically I choose it because I thought it’s interesting AchievementsThere isn’t any campus. I was a student of English Dept. at first and their faculties are way too rude and unprofessional. Otherwise BRAC University’s main problem is the CAMPUS.Opportunities, scopes, Residential semester, Bonding, education level is high.Just the CAMPUS Fact. We badly need a campus. And need official Annual tours for students. It’s a 50/50 situation. I expect a CAMPUS from BRAC University and more field works and experiences.Some are really good and some are really bad. Evaluation should be a serious concern "
Courses are very good and useful in North South University.
Some university's MCQ pattern is quite good and efficient way for evolving students.
The pattern of courses are perfect in private universities.
"CSE is my department.  I've been looking forward to studying computers since a very early age.BRACU has been making their name and fame for quite a few years. I looked around, asked a bunch of seniors, took advice from a relative who's a CSE-related job holder abroad and researched the base alumni situation of the university and also the interview board preferences.The only primary problem that comes to mind right now is the unavailability of a proper campus. There are way too many students enrolled but not enough space.The studying environment, CSE-teacher and the lecturers' cooperative attitude, the clubing experience, the facilities.My expectations are not being satisfied as I expect the university to care about their students, and by enrolling too many students, they are not giving much attention to the ongoing space-problem.There are Helpful and  knowledgable people (at least the older ones)."
All labs and practical is going on well without any other problems regarding outside situation.
Examination pattern and marks distribution all the terms are good.Ca and MTE also give the chance to students for improving. the campus must be improved though.
Depth of course was good in every Private University. But now providing a basic knowledge which is not so deep in subjects. At least they should provide deep knowledge and syllabus in core subjects.
All university's situation are uncertain. Students are fighting over every topic.
Complete wastage of time. Again this opinion is strictly personal and may not coincide with others.
It's good but we don't get sufficient time for participating in that activities.
practical work is good in our labs. In public I've heard that they ignore. But our faculties are serious.
The universities in bangladesh do not focus on creative learning they care about students moral value
Exam pattern is most important. The university has made great efforts on this and we appreciate it
Bangladesh universities are full of dirty politics East or west Bracu is the best.
library is providing excellent facilities and as a result we feel very lucky to enjoy all of these facilities
LL.B. I like this occupation. Subject and facilities are not adequate. Motive is to be a good lawyer. 
Only few universities gives opportunity to continue study with full free scholarship now a days.
Students that do not student student hard often gets poor marks.One must study properly in order to get good grades.
HAVE TO IMPROVE  the condition and also the administration of the university for the betterment
We are getting maximum knowledge as our faculties are very experienced. The course content is very helpful for learning new things.
All the activities are good and appropriate for students and so for this reason I love my university
All terms are good regarding the university activities.Knowing that there is a good chance of employability for graduates and the ability to gain industry experience are essential for me.
"course content of the university is good . that is important because without proper course content, there is no meaning of studying courses by paying so much money. I can just study in youtube."
I need a scholarship to continue my study in this university.
"They are mostly theory based. Very few universities have lab failities. Politics is everywhere. Students don't get much opportunity to learn and flourish. Not having variety of subjects to study etc. No campus, too many students, no place to chill, no common room or lounge."
Everything is fine. Every thing is taught in depth.Even a single point is elaborated enough to understand.
Transportation fees must be at a minimum fare. Too much paying for using university transport service.
Creative and writing facility is good. The faculties are professionals and they're smart. Really enjoy these professional creativity
Its important to have a good campus .But most of the private universities do not have a proper campus.
I guess for better opportunities in future Better education quality Campus of course and fees are higher Opportunity to learn Not getting enough practical knowledge or implementation of regular classesIt's kinda okay. 
From CSE Department. We have Best Space and we are provided by Quality education. Campus area almost satisfied. Education is not Good enough.
The way of teaching is good but we will be recognized as a lower education class just because it was private. I'll be judged by my tag.
"I am From the Department of business administration because in future i want to see myself as a successful human resource manager. I choose IUBAT because the tuition fees is comparatibly less but the environment is totally designed for learning. Each and every teacher of BBA department has a foreign degree. Transportation and disciplines are also good.   In IUBAT we have no air condition system. The transportation route should also be broaden.   The timing is strictly maintained. 1st term, mid term and final exm has fixed time span also the result date and the starting date of class and all other timing is perfect. Admission test is not taken strictly. All of our teacher should judge our talent properly.  Our university is perfect in one word. "
Lab and practical are not upto the mark. The topic which are practiced are almost already done before.
Quality of education in private universities are not good enough.
time is not sufficient and so we face a lot of problems in dealing with situations
I love my private university becuase my beautiful girls go there.
Facilities and fees of Brac and NSU is high but is very costly and so only rich people gets admitted here
My university is doing a great job I think in maintenance  and so far I am loving it
I got  admitted in CSE. Here nothing is fine. Everthing is very disorgannized and my feedback is the worst regarding my university.
I got admitted in BRAC UNIVERSITY CSE because I had passion and love towards this field since I was a kid. Everything is fine apart from the campus.I Wanted a quality education and I got it and so my feedback is Excellent.
"i dont know about public but if only we had campus, I think we are perfect already. the private have more value than the public"
We have good library facilities. LIbraries are enriched with a good collection of books. Labs are well equipped.
"Everything is very good. Interaction part is something like faculties mostly interact with each and every student, lecture delivery is very good and punctuality always maintains."
"excellent university, the mode of teaching is completely different than any other university. lecturers are very friendly with every one they interact just like friends and they are very punctual"
The university must ensure rights of the students. BRAC University should follow it strictly.
Some of the teacher are un experienced. Also they are unfair and baised. Infact many of the faculties are having few or no experience about the subject. 
The university consists of a whole world in itself.It is diverse and manages to conduct all events properly.I love being the part of this university where we get equal and all opportunities in all respects and fields.
It has a fair marking scheme and adaptable pattern and so is very suitable for the students
Private university all are good in Bangladesh. They provide world standard syllabus.
"Overall rating on this activity is 4.5/5. Very nice teaching and interaction between students and lectures which was good. Every time there will be new and fresh style in delivering the lectures ,thanks."
I think the university is doing just fine and also it is the best of all
the labs are not practically built and which becomes and issue for the students
Scholarship is what i am looking for when selecting universities. I want to transfer to a foreign university in the future.
The Universy Must have NICE TIMING for both students & faculties
its hard to find a computer working in lab. Students cannot save data in one single PC. there is lack of efficiency in the computer system of our university.
way of teaching is average. As a result we face a lot of problems in understanding and cannot do a good result.
"Belonging from a mid-lower class family higher education is like an white elephant. Had to work so hard just to reach to this point. Just for some unfortunate reasons, could got a chance of admission in a public University. Why does the reality had to be so painful and depressing. Life has turned into a joke. That's all I had to share."
"International Relations Subject i like the most. The faculties in a new department are not much. So, i am not having much classes and the chairman is biased. It is one of the largest Universities of Bangladesh. The mentality of Rajshahi locals and the people in this region. The expectations was to learn a lot about IR. I don't think I am satisfied enough. Average rating overall."
The environment in Private Universities is like a family. We all take care of each other.
Private University in Bangladesh has excessive tuition fees which is a very big problem because most of the people cannot afford it.
EXTRAORDINARY in a way because it is the best and also extracurricular activites are provided here
Private universities provides us with best pattern of examination.
Intimidation from a few students and a few lectures. Not organised way of teaching. Most Lectures fail to keep noisy and disrespectful students under control. Not enough time in lectures. Tutorials are rushed. Not the most friendly and supportive environment.
Easily available course material with sufficient knowledge gaining are the main advantages of studing in private university.
content of the courses are updated and mostly based on current technology. And so we can cope up with the current updates 
Awesome in a word and so I like my university and am glad to study here
The universities are poor with all most everything. Lack of facilities are highly noticeable.
"i am doing my MBA. Facilities are good.Expensive tuition fees.Tuition Fees are so high.Almost satisfied. There can be some rooms for little improvement.Very helpful and knowledgeableSince you are doing a survey about Bangldesh university scenario, you should include some other factors. Library, common room, canteen facilities, internet and computer accessibility in the campus, extra curricular activities etc"
Air conditioned buses are needed for comfortable travelling of the students . In this hot and humid country this a must.
More scholarship programs should be introduced for meritorious students and for higher studies. University should help students in case of finding foreign universities. 
 the faculties are knowledgebale and helps us interacting with other students which is why I love them
examination including exam pattern is good in some ways.MCQs should be given to students for the preparation of exams.
"The content of the courses are good but depth of courses are not enough to get the good concepts. So, I think that the contents should be up to the mark. "
LLB. Because I'm passionate about this subject. There's no campus.They provide the best education. Not enough space.We need Good campus
Distance has become a factor so good tranportation system is necessary so that students do not face transportation issues.
"North South University ECE department Education is satisfied. System, Community, Grading policies Satisfied. "
"Bachelor's of Science in Biochemistry & Biotechnology in BRAC University. 
Because I love biology and there is a future demand in this filed and has scopes for independent research. Because of the subject, achievements, facilities and good international relations. It is very expensive. Most of the classes are digitized and faculties are very helpful. Grading system is very strict and tought currently am in my first semester, so can't say yet."
"BRAC University CSE department, i choose it because my brother motivated me to admit into this particular department. He saw potential in me. They have no perticular campus. Faculties are helpful."
We are facing serious difficulties with our tuition fees. It is too much for us to handle.
Completing Environmental science because we all are the part of the environment. The homely environment and natural beauty of Chittagong University ttacts us. Satisfied but need to improve in some sectors.
"From the Department of business administration because in future i want to see myself as a successful human resource manager. I choose IUBAT because the tuition fees in comparbly less but the environment is totally designed for learning. Each and every teacher of BBA department has a foreign degree. Transportation and disciplines are also good. In IUBAT we have no air condition system. The transportation route should also be broaden. In IUBAT the timing is strictly maintained. 1st term, mid term and final exam has fixed time span also the result date and the starting date of class and all other timing is perfect. Admission test is not taken strictly. All of our teacher should judge our talent properly. Perfect place to study."
Private University in Bangladesh has campus issues and so we face many problems. And for this reason students prefer public universities more. 
when compared to other Private Universities we need better material and exposure in BRAC. our university only cares about money.
University of Dhaka is quite good. Outside university are so so.
Outstanding in a word and so I love my university a lot and want to graduate from here
i dont think the education system of our university is good enough. i think it could be better and i am not satisfied with it.
LPU gives the best opportunity for the students to show their talent.
I do not participate in any programs so I am bored and do not like any of the programs
"Not upto the mark when it comes to handling the students. need more resources, need to provide courses properly. it is awesome that there are so many types of food to eat everyday outside the campus."
library facilites are good in public universities. Lots of books and variations. You can't expect these in a university of a single building
As a poor country education of private university is very costly and not up to the mark that it should be. Tuition fees are increasing every year with the new comers.
This university experience is worse than dull. It destroyed the keen learner in me. What’s worse is some other departments seem fine but the psychology department has nobody to keep them in check.
We have no transportation system. So it becomes costly to use public transport everyday
it's good to have a negative marking pattern in exam but the time is not sufficient to do all the questions.
"Library, campus and standards of public universities are always over the top then any private university"
"I will suggest someone to study in BRAC University CSE Department. Because it is a flexible job. Residential Semesters have limited seats in course and advising. A good understanding of the field give us practical sense of life and life style of different back grounded people. When it's about satisfaction, i am moderately satisfied only Departmental Faculties were good and helpful. Only Departmental Faculties were good and helpful. Brac university try to fix the overcrowding situation. "
The books that are recommended do not contain appropriate content; leads the students to depend on slides given by faculties. Hence the knowledge remains superficial
"BRAC University has no proper campus. The brand value and acceptance in job sector is now high. Strict administration. More student friendly initiatives, specially transportation service. Diverse qualified.  "
"Capacity of library is less compared to size of university. The university lacks security , anyone can get in with a fake ID card"
all the books are easily available and accessable and the limit of book issued need to be increased
Lab practicals and class evaluations are below average and need lot of changes and improvements.
Univerity in bangladesh are not too bad. They have modern facilities but are nothing compared to foreign universities
Every thing is good. Subjects have a very good depth. Almost all the books are available in the library and more than that 4/5
I am from CSE Department.Brac University.I have chosen this subject as this in demand.I happy everything about my university.Grading and less holidays are the main problems.The faculties are generally good.
"Subject, facilities, achievements, fee based on that i will recommend to choose AIUB, BRACU, NSU. Don’t know yet about other university. To be able to bring out my best output in BRACU."
"To learn about English language and literature For lower tuition fee-Transport system  is not available 
Wi-fi connection is not available in the Whole University .
Less number of books in the Library .
VC are not approved by UGC. but on the processing may be.
A case is filed against BOT member.
There is no permanent Campus..-Low cost.
Teachers are qualified and friendly .
Students are so friendly -conflict among BOT members.
Not giving attention to upgrad the University of the BOT members. 
We need 
Transport system .
permanent Campus.
High speed wi-fi connection .
approved VC.
Huge collection of books in the library -very friendly.
qualified.
sincere .
I think you will give the messages which I share to our authority and play important rule to improve the quality of our university  as well as the others university of our country "
I chose CSE department at BRAC University as I always liked this sort of things and always had interest in networking. Lot of facilites and achievements. No campus and lack of adequate study materials regarding some courses. To grow more interest in practical work  and extra co-curricular activities and they are being satisfied.
As per the courses all the subjects are providing worth knowledge and its very much object oriented.
"EEE Facilities, achievements attracts me the most. Quality of students admitted is deteriorating. Quality of education. High fees new campus, more faculties in EEE dept, reasonable fee structure; not being satisfied. Overall Brac university is good. "
Practicals are good but evaluations are not because they don't give enough time to work.
"As my residence is far away from University, attending the class on regular basis has become a challenge for me. So its very important to start transportation system as soon as possible"
"Due to unavailability of proper transport system, distance becomes a big issue. Also, the tuition fees are too high."
I think number of books are very less according to the students .Only 2-3 copies are available.
From the Department of LLB. This was the first university where i got the chance. No campus here. Nothing. Everything Only to survive some are extremely not good.
I like it Reputation and standard No campus Curriculum and our chairperson and VC Campus issue
Teachers are doing their job well in the university. Our faculties are giving us time to make us understand our topics.
"As there is no facilities of transport, it decrease of student's skill because of wasting time on roa. "
The tuition fee is a big issue. Not all of us are able to afford the high tuition fees of private universities.
exam pattern is good and marks distribution is also good but paper checking is too hard
Its good and proper design for EEE at BRAC University. We like the courses.
As per the lab evaluation we are satisfied with it. Our labs are well equiped.
"Education system is appreciable. Students who are having interest in co curricular activities, getting a good platform."
Yes our education system is very good. Every university in our country has to adopt tough laws to exclude rags.
the content of the course should be optimum. Private universities have optimum content but public are only focused on politics
Our library contains all the books regarding courses and other materials and very cooperative library staff.
"In private universities they provide us with good lab faculities, which is very important as it gives us proper practical experience"
"Jahangir Nagar University Pharmacy, as it is a multidisciplinary subject. Reputation, Facilities, Companionship, Political environment this are better than other University. The facilities so provided aren't satisfactory. Good but need improvement."
BRAC UNIVERSITY CSE is the best. TARC was the best among all universities. Education System is Good. Not all of faculties were good 
We have a very good library facilities.Issuing time of book must be increased
There is good evaluations in lab regarding practical and so far I like it
Private univerity students are generally thought to be less qualified than public university students.
I like the question pattern and find it interesting in a way and also exciting
excellent but checking procedure is not exceptable since we fail to know our faults in mid term..
Satisfactory over all. University of Bangladesh try to make differences now.
rough handling approach of the university is annoying. we need more time and pace.
"I like it , i am satisfied all these work of BRAC university."
"The administration should be more supportive towards the students in every university. In public university, student suffer more for administration support.     "
the faculties are amazing and help to boost our stamina and so we enjoy a lot
Education System is very good. I think this is upto the mark. Great for me.
 only good thing in this university is that it is near my house and so it takes less time to reach 
"More scopes has to be there in private universities. Many subjects missing, syllabus missing, freedom missing and more"
Choosed English because i always wanted to study literature. Number 1 private university in Bangladesh has lack of English students and campus. The place is crowded. Need more available sections and more offers on some courses.
Public transport is not safe for female students. So we need transportation system provided by University.
Private university in bangladesh are very good indeed. They have more achievements than the public universities
everything is good in my university and also the courses are fine and interesting
Library facilities are excellent.The system in terms of searching books is really good.
"there are lot of extracurricular activites held in university but so many of them are unknown to us ,the problem is there is no such ad's viewed to us. my rating is 3/5"
"Computer science and engineering, It has demandIt's good and have facilities though the fees is very high. The fee is very very high.Some awsome faculties are there. campus is horrible. Don't know yet about students, Some are too good,and sone of them are average for me"
Extracurricular activities are good. It helps people to know their talent and build up their skills.
Well organised and maintained. uni has been a great experience for me so far. i enjoy my course and the friends i have made. my advice would be make sure the uni you should is the one you want.
"Majoring Marketing. Because i find it interesting subject.They have achievement,reputation. I Don't like the open credit system. Permanent teacher members are good. Part time teacher members can not teach properly.    "
Right now The private univerties are doing better than the public unversities. The reason behind this politics free campus.
North South University is quite good. They should provide more materials of courses.
"I am from Dept.of Architecture. This was the only subject i felt passionate about. Facilities and campus are good, Biased grading. I wish my dept was less biased towards few students. This only thing almost made me loose interest in my subject. Also nsu has a very difficult grading system compared to other famous universities.which they should consider but they surely dont Biased."
"Teachers are good in subject,and punctuality. They are very helpful."
High fee is disturbing us mentaly. Every university wants high fee. It should be more reasonable.
Transportation facilities must be ensured for all the students and at a minimum fare. This facility must be ensured throughout the day.
"First semester's modules could have been more targeted to learning software. A few pointless modules e.g TRAP. Overall not too bad, could use more independent learning resources."
"I choose CSE, because I had an interest towards computers.Subject and Campus are the important while finding the best university.Our faculties are not very capable and we need a campus."
Tuition fee is too much. Its a great hinder for completing my graduation properly
All the terms are good regarding the university activities.
All the faculties are doing there job well and so I love them
Best for Engineering Are Private Universities because of their facilities.
BRAC UNIVERSITY has no proper campus. We expect better campus environment.
I am satisfied because I earned a lot of knowedge and  it has proper course material
Dhaka University is very good. There we can find several course books and we can find several reference books also.
"BRAC UNIVERSITYCS. Hardcore STEM majors leaves you with most options in future. CS. Hardcore STEM majors leaves you with most options in future. Other students. Club activities. 3 month Residential Semester in Savar. Campus size is not in proportion with number of students enrolled. Didn't know what to expect. In retrospect, I could have put the money to better use. Mediocre. Mediocre. No thanks. "
some faculties aren't doing their jobs in a well manner and so it is a problem for the students
Practical work is fair so more and more lab works should be assigned
Private & Public Universities must have good material in labs. But our country only cares about money and saving it.
BBA  is Ongoing Demand Subject. Campus & Quality education . Huge number of students than the capacity. Quality of education and  quite satisfied. Performance Vary from person-to-person
There is not special about private univerties. Private universities are all about money.
there are many courses which are irrelevant to the branch. some topics are not covered. There is no proper material for any course
I am from BBA department and I am satisfied in every possible ways with my university
"Basically I want to learn about cse for exploring it's vast field. An university's reputation, educational quality are the most important aspects. Lack of space in our campus is a problem. Educational quality becomes poor due to lack of space for students. The faculties are very friendly."
Everything would be fine if there are less number of students in our btech CSE.
not every one is getting opportunities here only recommended students getting.
University's buses are not air conditioned. So we have to travel by public transport.
Pattern and procedure of the examination is very good. Paper checking needed to be improved.
"The faculties of the university is fully knowledgeable. This is crucial for any university. however, we do lack space and campus."
excellent.university is the best while providing facilties and etc .. for extra curricular activities
"The materials or links provided for study purpose is good, clarity in depth of courses but again it differs from teacher to teacher."
"Private universities  need to stop thinking that they're best in education, They have enough money to improve and bring innovations."
The activities are very good but no time is given to students for participation. So its of no use.
Every thing is excllent but paper checking is not good. Sometimes it seems like biased.
"Not good because in lab, faculties donot teach us how to work on live projects or how to make a live project. So i have observed that whatever faculties have been teachig us in lab that will not be useful in our future life."
My university is pretty well i think. i am satisfied with the result. but the cost is very high.
Private universities have got excellent work environment. The faculties are well paid.
My department is Microbiology because this subject has always fascinated me. MNS dept is the strongest in brac.There is no campus. No sufficient space. Nothing is fine. But still I love my university. 
CSE. It was somewhat my parents' influence and also this subject to be at the top that made me choose it. The campus used to be near my house. Education policy is very strict. It's very hard to maintain good grades with strict faculties and education policy and also the huge competitiveness. It's campus. Huge amount of pressure given to the students and not caring whether they can cope with it or not. I would like to learn and gain knowledge as much as possible while staying here. But all the pressure of maintaining a good grade doesnt allow that. Teachers are well educated but not all are well suited in teaching . Facilities are good.
"I AM FROM CSE DEPARTMENT, I LIKE MACHINES CAUSE I DIDN'T STUDY ENOUGH FOR A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY. THEN I CHOSE WHICHEVER WAS TOP ON THE LIST (ALPHABETICALLY)LACK OF SPACE, STUDENT NUMBER 5X OF THE CAPACITY, CAFETERIA FOOD NOT GOOD AT THE MOMENT (IT WAS GOOD BEFORE)GOOD MANAGEMENT AND STUDENT SUPPORT. AWESOME FACULTIES. ENCOURAGING STUDENTS FOR CREATIVE ACTIVITIES. AND OF COURSE TARCNO CAMPUS, NO HYGIENE CAFETERIA (THE FOOD, SURROUNDINGS ARE GREAT), NOT UPDATED COURSE PLAN AND OF COURSE TAKES A LOT OF MONEY BUT NOT EQUIVALENT FACILITYA GOOD COURSE PLAN, EMPHASIZING ON HELPING STUDENTS SOLVE REAL WORLD PROBLEMS, A HEALTHY ENVIRONMENTOUTSTANDING! (OF COURSE THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS)CAN I GET AN OVERALL RESULT OF THE FINAL DATA !?!?! NVM"
"BBA, I'd like to work in the business fieldAchievements, the board at BRAC University and the founders are very well known, and a lot of professors have suggested BRAC over other private universitiesThe lack of space, there's no space to spend recreational time in.The quality of education, the faculties, and the value of the degree we're gettingThe lack of spaceUniversity's should have proper campuses, especially in modern times like this. Everything else is great, other than the lack of space. Mostly Great"
LIbrary contains Insufficient books. Faculties are not helpful. Most of them are not experienced so we face several problems.
"Making new software, appplications etc always intrigued me.Due to not getting a seat in the preferred subjects in public universities. Brac university cse was the next best option amongst private universities. Brac the ngo in itself is something I admired and wanted to be a part of it.Not having a proper campus is one of the major problems. In my opinion campus provides a better learning environment and also the hassel of moving from one side of the road to the other for class wouldn't be an issue then. If you are willing to learn certain elements that's crucial for a discipline and healthy lifestyle, residential semester can teach a lot of it. I think every university should have such a semester or two.Lack of a proper campusI expect promises to be kept. I expect them to listen to the students and back them up in certain cases which might be a little controversial, but they should be assertive than being diplomatic.Not much to complain, good enough."
"Subject,facilities,achievment,scholarship i focused most. Brac or NSU university gives quality education Computer science and engineering."
Cse is my subject because I couldn't get admit to my desired university .Everything from education to food facility is disorganized.It has no place to sit. We need more rest.We are paying a lot of money atlest we dont deserve a fresh graduate as a teacher. We need experienced faculties who can teach well those type of faculties should be our teacher instead of moody fresh graduates. I only had 3 good faculties in my 4years of education. . Ish..dzk and saiful sir...other than them I dont want to comment 
Private university library facilities are not good.They are not following the rules( they are using phones in library).
No facilities for a student to work on his/her potential. Education quality is questionable. Teachers quality are dropping exponentially.University kills creativity and makes everyone think alike. No thinking outside the box because they have a curriculum to follow
University in Bangladesh don't provide proper rights to women. There's lack of security & opportunities.
"examination checking sucks here , don't knw why I get low marks even if 4 qustions are wrong . answer key of exam is absurd, discrepancy system is not advantageous, answers of exam not right, omr should be uploaded"
My university is so far away from my home and so I think that they should have  a transport system.
Teacher are punctual but they should also give us the some practical knowledge on the topics.
"I chose CSE because I love to code.Facilities, Campus, Pre-advising are amazing things about this university. My expectations are having a campus, having great facilities, having friendly faculties. They are partially being satisfied.."
"Beside the University campuses there should be footover birdges, zebra crossing and traffic signal lights for safety of the students."
The depth of course is very much deep. According to me its very essential.
Computer Science and Technology. I chose this department because cse is the most potential sector of study now a days. And vastness of variety of sectors that depends on cse attracted me. High Fees must be reduced. This institute doesn’t provide enough opportunities for co-curricular activities.  Closed credit. Helps to fulfil courses in time. And a very up to date syllabus. Sometimes faculties have very high expectations that pressurizes students. Mostly satisfied but yet there are some conditons to develop. I have mixed opinion here. Some are very talented and up to date with recent studies. And they are helpful. But some are boring and not quite up to date 
Better lab facilities are needed. More working computers are needed in the computer labs.
I like my university . All faculties and facilities are extramly good.
They are really very intersting. All the students enjoys a lot and get a chance to showcase there talent.
No proper views. I don't care about university now. They are same.
BRAC University CSE has good facilities. They achieves lots of students. 
University offers a lot of activities which is excellent on their part as students are able to explore themselves.
In some points private universities are better than public university. No politics is allowed in any private university. All study metterials are available in a fixed dates. Classes are well scheduled. Medical facilities are far better than public universities. Faculties are more helpful and friendly than public universities.
All the given terms are good regarding IUBAT university. Have proper campus.
Labs are upto the mark in the Private Universities. We also have freedom.
I think private universities are better than public universities. They are career oriented and corporate focused. And provides us with practical based knowlwdge.
"Actually I am searching University on the basis of their accomplishments and facilities . And of course which offers best under less cost.  BRAC University ,North South University ,IUB,AIUB ,EWU. I have passion in mechanical engineering and cse engineering . But unfortunately there aren't much option for mechanical engineering . Only a few Private Universities offer mechanical engineering . So I have to take cse engineering . There must be a good environment for learning and politics free environment of course . And University should introduce various plans for new research and development activities . Financial aid for research and development should be given . More scholarship programs should be introduced for meritorious students and for higher studies University should help students in case of finding foreign Private Universities . "
exam pattern and marks distribution are good and so I love it so much
course material is perfect but we need fixed credit system. there are students studying for 10 years
 Average 3.5/5 and for this reason it is an average university with normal courses
lab practical work can further be improved so that it can meet industrial standards
In my opnion very less content is their in our syllabus..it will be good if there is more syllabus and depth included in our syllabus
its very tough and very diffcult to understand
"I want to get admitted in CSE.I personally like universities with interesting subject, achievements, good lab facilities.I don't like too much student. Every semester too many students are getting and not adequate sitting arrangement.I expect my university will provide me a proper campus but they didn't provide it yet."
"Because I love nature and have a strong desire to protect it.Basically the campus and its reputation.Too much pressure, extreme fees, not good enough facilities, bad facultiesConnectionsSame as ""Problems"" question Expectations are definitely NOT being met. We should have a better course outline, more outward connections, better facilities such as better WiFi etc Mostly not good"
I need waiver. My family can not bear this huge amount of tuition fees.
"I am really happy to be studying at BBS. I like the family atmosphere provided. The fact that it is a small university, everyone is made really accessible and help can be seeked at any time. The student community is really tight and everyone knows everyone. Senior students are always happy to help and answer questions. It is a lot of work but you can feel yourself improving every day. I love the combination between theory and practicals. Moreover, the nutrition clinic, naturopathy and dissections are great additions. The tutors and other lecturers are all really knowledgeable and approchable. Coming from a foreign country, I am certain that I made the right decision choosing bbs for my education."
The tuition fee is so high. So many students are depriving of having higher studies from reputed University like this university.
"Now-a -days I think that distance has become a great issue and for this I am facing a lot of problems. So, I need proper scholarship and also proper transport system."
Our faculties are excellent  but they reduce the speed of teaching  and so  the students faces problems in understanding the concepts 
I'm definitely looking for the best university for studying cse.Ahsanullah University Of Science & Technology is the best for Computer Science & Engineerin.I like cse because I love coding and building up the algorithms.Expecting a better facility from my unversity.More practical than the theoretical about studies are needed.Teachers should be friendly.And their must be a good environment for knowledge.
"I chose EEE for it's Fame. More students are admitted  than the capacity. Teachers are very strict so not satisfied,"
"In labs,the lecturers has to interact with each student to improve their knowledge, in all the ways,before giving us the work they must explain about the experiment once so that we will come to know how to perform and take precautions while doing it."
"I like coding so CSE is my Subject. good things are achievements, faculties, alumnis, location.Campus is not up to the mark, hence, demotivating. The CSE department, the people in it. The staffs. And most people in general. Somehow, majority of them are friendly and kind.The Campus. Short time for each courses makes learning process very difficult.It sure is guiding me towards something. Expectations are limitless. Good"
Very poor resource to teach student I hate my university. Nothing to say. I don't want to tell about their problems here
"Good, but there should be at least  a practical subject in every semester so that students can improve practically"
"I am from BRAC UNIVERSITY.My desired department was Computer Science and Engineering.  Before being enrolled in the university I did not know much about my desired subject but as days went by gradually I was acquiring in depth knowledge about cse and I was liking it.Quality education was the prime factor. Other than that the faculties were cooperative and BRAC University tends to maintain strict standard on all aspects.  Quality education was the prime factor. No university campus, overcrowded university premises are the main problems.My expectation from my university was to learn new things and be prepared for the upcoming challenges in life. Overall, I was satisfied but there are more scopes for improvement. University faculties were cooperative and facilities can be further improved. University faculties were cooperative and facilities can be further improved. "
They are giving good knowledge for us. We need more University.
For a country like Bangladesh the the university fees are not affordable at all. The Univerity grand commision must do something about this and ensure a minimum fee cap.
"As a Fresher, I am finding it difficult to understand my course structure since I am new to this open credit system. I am finding it hard to communicate with IT department. I am not happy with our campus security. Furthermost, we need good facculties."
The Education system of my university is good. it was knowledgeable. The depth of the course is good but proper course materials in only for some subjects
library facilities are good but number of books are less. there should be more computers also since they are taking so many students. also the clubs should have more facilities.
ESS department of BRAC University is not good. Teaching is quite good. I cant get extra time for extra knowledge. Interaction is good.
"Knowledgeable is Good, Depth of course is satisfying, proper course material is also good"
increasing confidence among students by giving proper grades. the semester is quick and we get results very quickly.
"I'm from NORTH SOUTH UNIVERSITY,Architecture department.Campus Facilities are the best.Grading Policy is the worst. Grading policy is the only problem as most university is good."
I am from NORTH SOUTH UNIVERSITY and my Department is Pharmaceutical Sciences. Faculty Service is very good. Education environment is good.
"I choose Journalism as my department. I choosed journalism because this is my passion related Subject, facilities, achievements I can't remembering!! Sorry!! Unity. Management can be better one from now!! Our faculties are Generous, galible, strict, almost perfect!!"
I want to join army after graduation. Achievements of an university is the most important thing. Facilities are important as well.  Teachers take care personally and Class schedule is important.
My department is Economics & Social Sciences.  I chose this one because i thought there is a lot of opportunities ahead for the studentsof Economics.  The facilities are good but there is a  Huge number of students but no proper campus. Along with the studies it appreciates the other activities.    And nobody allows  bullying and harassment.   We have a Small space.I expect from my university to have more lecturers and more space.So basically our faculties are very much helpful and kind and resourceful. 
"ECE is the subject that I study. Money oriented oppression towards students is seen . Faculties are not good and a lot of prssure is given to students. Pressure makes me strong.Bad lab facilities and also there is no inside smoking zone, no wifi. Nation wise we have to start practising ethics"
Teachers are supposed to let the students know the actual use of the instruments used in the lab.
"Content of course is perfectly in line with the teaching philosophy that is being perpetuated here i.e cramming,rote learning."
"Most of the private universities suck. They don't maintain certain qualities, there's no standard which all universities can follow so that we can compare/evaluate every graduate in a proper way. Few well known Public universities are doing good. However, there's room for improvement. As a student of BRAC university, i can say that the overall performance is satisfactory.However, there's still a lot of work which needs to be done to become the best private university in Bangladesh. For instance, campus area, sufficient well qualified faculties, research and real life work oriented study plan etc should be introduced as soon as possible."
it is good learning these courses and getting practical experience. But we need a campus to breath probably.
According to me everything is going well in accordance to interaction.More than enough is served.
Teachers are average but facilities are horrible now. Every university need to improve it.
"English and Humanities, Cause BRACU is one of the top Private Universities in BD.No campus, bad grading criteria (mostly grading system) , Not satisfied with university rules, English faculties are nice bt very strict "
The cost of going to a university which has a  long distance is very much so the university should provide us with a transportation system.
Majoring CSE & I take it because I love coding. Open credit system is quite helpful. Academic oriented curriculum. In residential semester dorms are middle of the road. They need to create more room for innovation. I haven't understand What's this survey for when they don't apply it properly.
Teachers give us all the information required to improve the performance. I am thankful to them.
Educational quality should be increased. There is Lack of study environment
books are less in the library and it is a problem because all students cannot afford buying books so library is the only option for them
Content of every courses is the best thing in Dhaka University. I like it.
We don't get answers key and even the question papers for our mcq exams.There should be some means by which we could recheck our answers and get to know what mistakes we have made.
"I love my university, events it is providing, great opportunity for students to learn more instead of just sitting and listening to the lecture. I would recommend it to anyone"
"UIU is my university and I STUDY ENVIRONMENT. It has the Best Faculty.TOO MUCH STRIKE FOR MARKING.IF YOU are  SERIOUS ABOUT STUDY, YOU NEED TO ADMIT in this university OR JUST AVOID IT because it is Too much strict"
Most universities are money making institutions obviously except public. Most of the universities are not preparing the students for the future .They just makes a lot of money.
"before coming to lpu i thought sports were very good n encouraging.but, there are many politics in sports especially in cricket."
"I am from CSE because my father wanted me to study cse but he didn't pressurized.Achievements and subjects are most important while choosing universities.Faculties  don't teach properly so I have to learn it on my own which I feel like waste of my tuition fees.I am also doing 6 or 7 days classes per week ,which is quite tiring.Faculties of cse department are quite friendly.Small cafe, no place to sit and too many students.Teachers who are more qualified are needed.The university hhould intake a very small number of students until a bigger campus is ready. We need better PC in our lab. CSE faculties are really nice and approachable but EEE faculties are scary. "
Course contents are very much relevant to our courses. Dhaka University is better in it.
"Talk about punctuality, it's really good but the lecture delivery is somehow not appreciated because every teacher has different style of teaching, so lack of knowledge in terms of subject is there and interaction is also kind of boring. A teacher should be entertaining as well but they are really not. All they want us to stay disciplined which is really not the thinking of every student."
Average in a word. Nothing special because I find other universities better
BRAC University CSE department SubjectEnvironmental Problem Nothing Environment and crowd. A Peacful Enviroment And A peaceful library(bigger).
"The quality of labs are not satisfactory, lab work must include latest technologies."
Private universities are not affordable without a proper tranportation and also without scholarship.
Our university has lot of extracurricular going on and it helps us a lot. We can find many opportunities to make us stronger for our future.
University needs a bigger campus.
some of the teacher are not uploading slides and thus we are not getting necessary materials. We have to do a lot of self study and that is not nice.
Our University is  upto the mark and it is the best among all others
Teaching is good but some faculties are not able to interact properly and are not able to clear the concepts properly. Most of the faculties are punctual.
Our Lab and practical works are good. With a little draw back of teacher in connecting the lab practical to the outside world.
Our university's education environment is neither too good nor too bad.Its average in most cases.
"The pattern in which the total marking is done is very complicated. Adding Class tests, mid terms , lab , attendance and assignments along with finals."
"Architecture Department facilities, atmosphere, friends everything is good at BRAC University. A bit too crowded place though. Diversity, Culture mixed here. Some Authorative personals are unqualified. Good at  professionalism. Mostly great. Private Universities are opening up everywhere. Most of them are not maintaining a good quality. It should be quality over quantity. The university culture in Dhaka city should be rethought and established property."
examination pattern in private universities are excellent. There is competition. the private have more success than the public
The faculties are very dependable and trustworthy. Then know what they are teaching.
I am from Department of Architecture. I chose this subject simply because I always wanted to be an architect.NSU is well renowned and has better facilities than most universities. I think these aspects influenced me to choose NSU. And of course the campus was a major factor.I personally didn't face that many problems in my university but it has some authoritarian issues that they should be conscious of. Faculties are highly qualified.Authority takes a lof of time to solve any problem.Authority should invest more to improve facilities.Teachers are great. Facilities are good but could be better.
The quality of eduction is good but it would be better if  the standard of Courses could be inproved. 
"Brand Value, Quality Education It doesn't have a campus The faculties It doesn't have a campus Being recognized anywhere I go just by the name of my University. People will automatically know how my skills are depending on where I'm graduated from. I think my expectations will be satisfied, don't know yet.Teachers are the best assets of my University,We don't have a large campus so I'm disappointed with the facilities"
EEE is the Fame of a university. So they should focus more on EEE. the private have better EEE than the public
"I think stock is not enough, more books are required. We need assistants in the lab so that they can coperate. we need sports facilities. we really need a campus actually."
Punctuality is good. Most of the faculties are not interacting with students .
I like reading books in Library.
they are good but they should give exposure to more students and not the same.
"CGPA is not the only method of judgement Reputation Too many students.Business strategy No campus At least some courses should be offered based on the current demands. No, they are not met. Only the basics are taught Adequate The university really should stop admitting so many students in one subject"
BBA Finance. Because my future interests are related to businessesBest Private University for BBAQuality of student bodyFaculties and access to resourcesStudent qualityMy expectations from my university is whether it can help me be someone who can leave behind a legacy and establish change. So far it is hard to say whether or not the university has satisfied that.Great
Knowledge is maximum gained by reading books and also faculties explain the concept in depth.
"it is not very deep when itn comes to knowledge, but we get a quick semester and this motivates me to study. it's not too boring. we can graduate quickly."
"Programming competitions, business competitions and other such competative events must be arranged though the year."
My university is so so not very great but okay! What else you can expect from a bangladeshi University.
All is good  in our university and so we enjoy a lot here and also can spend quality time
"CSE. I like to play with computer.facilities are good.Space Shortage of University area.Too many people to meet and get helped and learn everything new daily.No Space for Indoor games(Only Carom and Table Tennis) and outdoor gamesWant to go abroad for higher studySome are so much friendly like kids, some are like Hitler . Just want to change the education system, like if I am studying only in Computer Science or even other fields then I might have a little knowledge about other courses but not force to learn other departments courses.Because it knocks out from the path of the determination that we are focusing on. It's good to be brilliant and be knowledgeable but for a development country we might focus to be like Developed countries.
Thank you so much for the survey"
"Exam pattern and how it is conducted is  good .But in my first year and when I went to scrutiny for the first time it was not as per my expectations. Teachers have marked the answers as per their choice, they must look for the content rather than the length of answers. Poor paper checking is the main problem."
I studied in my subject because I love it. For now i face no problem at all. Teaching staffs are good. Universities are very satisfactory.
Good marks distribution .Students can easily check there performance throught the semester and seek improvement which is really amazing.
The examination system of the university is very impressive. The sitting plan of he students is made in such a way that no 2 students of same class give the exam in same room or even sometimes same blocks. Through this students also get to know and visit different blocks of the university.The checking is also fair .
Content does not provide deep knowledge as students and their parents expects.
"I am at BRAC UNIVERSITY, Computer Science! The curriculum is good.I didnt like tarc.The campus isnt great"
Universities are not focusing on education. They're rather focused on getting a higher rank and getting more money.
One of the best things I like about this university is it's facilities. The best of computers and technology is provided which makes us work well.
I study Biochemistry and Biotechnology .Subject and Faculties are most important.I love our faculties and the way they reach out to us. I want to see students achieve good grades.Sometimes there are few faculties who are not friendly.
every thing is fine but there is oo much to spend on. They lack scholarships. the tuition fee is very high.
East West University is kinda good for pharmecy department. Other departments are not that much good. 
"I'm from CSE, Brac University.The culture of this University matches more with my culture. Here most students are focused into studies than any other University. Moreover, it has one of the best CSE department of this Country.  Not Getting proper courses timely ,no place to sit Quietly And everything is a bit too congested are the main problems.  It genuinely educates us to be a perfect and qualified man for job and life.The Open Campus and Its Rented Buildings is something that I hate. The Expectations are a Campus which is being told to be satisfied but when, it is not yet sure. 
Moreover,  expectations are also to reduce the tution fees which will never be reduced unfortunately.  University Teachers are great but not all of them. But most of them are helpful. The facilities are good but not the Best."
"My major subject is BBA.
All the subjects of BBA is interesting. It is one of the best private university. Brac university doesn't has a campus. Maintains a very strict discipline. Good rules, regulations and discipline.
They are being satisfied."
Too much lab file work in University. we need more practical knowledge but we also need balance in system.
Private Universities are not goverment's lab dogs
"Excellent but it depends upon teacher. as a teacher of public , i can testify that private universities can be a great source of inoovation and revolution of education in bangladesh."
"BBS department in BRAC UNIVERSITY need to improve for supported courses. There is no proper campus, rough behaviour of faculties, inefficient teacher is noticeable. Bright students with no proper semester. Bad examination schedule. Reschedule of semester is average. Nothing gonna work untill the university board want so."
Education system over Bangladesh is not much good. Universities should develop.
some courses are irrelevant as they are not related to my stream so I find this thing very stupid.
in our university the content of course is ample but depth must be more. Faculties are well behaved.
some of our teacher member are not so experienced that's why most of the time we are facing problems subjects like CSE
I chose CSE department as I want to study engineering. Because of its facilities and achievement. This university do not have a proper campus .The academic facilities it provides to the students. The campus of this university .My expectations from this university is to have a proper campus and to improve its transport services.  
"examination pattern is good but,,there is blunder mistake.that is we ha no alternate to check the mistake where we have done morever no question papers also not given for discussion.so i suggest to..provide option for checking mistakes in the MCQ exams such as midterm."
Bangladeshi Universities are quite good. They varies by depending on teacher and their experience.
"Following the trend Fame . No place for students. Only classroom available. 
Not enough  resource for learn new things. Some good Faculties Open Credit is the most amazing thing about university."
In Brac university there is lot of events and lot of extra curriclar activities.
Labs helps to know how the work is done when it comes to private universities.It thought a student good lessons for practical day to day life.
"Content of courses are good, these are very knowledgeable, depth of course is also there but sometimes proper course material is not there."
good facilities are provided in my university and I am proud of it
Everything is fine and if this continues then I can graduate with a good CGPA
"CSE,Popularity Accomodations, Pretty girls, Lack of space, Moving to proper campus ASAP"
"From the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. I chose it because this was my second option to chose after medical and also i found myself interested in website designing. BRAC University is one of the best academic universities where i can get a lot of opportunities to build up my career. Time management issues and not getting expected courses with desirable faculties. Also we don't have a campus. Festives, occasions and clubing is fantastic here. Not getting expected courses with desirable faculties. Also we don't have a campus. Another thing, University expense is very costly. Expectations are: We will have our courses with desirable faculties. For the retake courses university should take less money(50% of the usual payment of one course).Having main campus. Sincere and helpful faculties. Some of them are so good, but as some of them are inexperienced, so we face problems while doing the class. Some of them are enough qualified but couldn’t guide us properly."
I study in CSE. I was interested in cyber security. In my South East University there is no campus of their own. Too cramped. The variety of people. Not having a campus and bad transport services. Easier transport service and a good campus is mostly wanted.
some of them are very helpful and knowledgeable and some are just formality
"The evaluation is again bad for our CA, as one of our teacher is really weird. He gives us remarks on the basis of how we present things in front of it, he never look for the content of our answer, which is really annoying. As he expects us to deliver answer in the way he wants us to do. But how can a person do that, as people do have different mentality and they do explain themselves in different manner, so a teacher must understand that quality of a child and should give him marks on the basis of what they say not what they should say."
"AIUB is my university and I study in CSE because this is the age of technology and it helped most to touch the deep .Unwanted pressure and their teaching environment .Too much concern about study and students careers.Authorities are 110% Business minded and the Teaching style ,environment,faculties everything was up to mark except the over business minded steps of authority .Overall this is one of the nice places to learn.Teachers were damn. Every one had 2 faces one soft and friendly ,other was too rude. At exam hall and attendance issues i found there other face.Teachers were damn. Every one had two faces one soft and friendly ,other was too rude. At exam hall and attendance issues i found there other face."
"I decided it because hacking attracted me in the very beginning. Now the situation changes.Subject and my mother likes the university. Thats why. Open credit. I think, fixed credit is better for me.They are trying to improve. I like it.No campus. Open credit.Students are not that much involved with university. University should give them wide space. No restrictions."
"Material of the course is not good enough to compete international realm. We need to seek beyond what we have and look forward to further development like Oxford, harvard and others."
"Wanted to learn programming, so i choiced CSE at BRAC University. Campus is overly crowded. Too many students being admitted whereas there's less classroom and less teacher for which it's hard to get courses, and they are not really taking any initiative for this issue. "
not good..the timing is too much for labs and syllabus is also so vast.we don't get propr revision
Our labs do not have all facilities.
East West university is very poor in education. No equipments are there available here.
CSE Wanted As Subject. Lack Of Faculties & Skills. Space Problems In the university.
Probably the best part of university is its examination and its pattern.
extracurricular activities are good. And so I like this university
Practical work including evaluations are good so that students can learn about practicals.
Practical and easy learning approaches. Loving the way they teach cse. Not everyone can teach cse easily amd make it understandable.
Satisfied but universities are giving too much pressure on students which i cant supportNot satisfied
"Completed Microbiology from BRAC University. Microbiology Study plan, environment and opputunities are high. Study quality moderate. Strict descipline. Expect to get opportunities of more scholarship and I am satisfied with my university. "
Most Universities in Bangladesh lacks technology for research work.
More extra curicullar activites needs to be introduced. Eveyone has to perticipate in such activities.
"So far, being a first year student, I've enjoyed a lot if aspects about university. The work load is extraordinary but it comes with the course I chose. My biggest fear going into Uni was meeting new people but now, through events organised by my courses society, I have a great group of pals both within and outwith the course."
"CSE major. I like the programming. I did not get chance in public. So, I chose the top one in private BRAC University. There are lots of problems. First of all, too many students are being admitted, stretching beyond the limit. This is deteriorating the university life for the students. The campus is crammed up all the time. Secondly, the quality of the students is quite low which is mainly due to a poor admission process. Campus and the teaching stuffs. I have come across some of the best faculties, who have taught me many things. Poor admission process, Poor administration, Poor internet, Poor computer labs. My expectation is that the authority would be kind enough to listen to the problems of the students and come to a reasonable solution. After all, it's the students who are suffering. No, they are not being satisfied. As I said earlier, I have come across some of the best faculties in my life and I consider myself lucky to have known them, even if it is for a little while."
"I study Philosophy. I didn't choose it, it chose me.Fees are most important in selecting universities. I study for free at public university. Also I don't have to rely on parents to live my life anymore.Most of the students are dumb. And I can't relate to the smart ones in my class, because they're too smart. I'm average. I expect my faculties to understand me. But They don't. Because no one gets me. I'm not satisfied because they have classes at 9 in the morning, for which I have to wake up at 7. Facilities suck, but then, I expect no more since I'm studying for free, quite half-literally. Some faculties are way too cool, and some are poor (no offense). Yeah, I'm interested in the results of your survey. Like why you're conducting it and how and what goals are being met. Please reach out to me at facebook.com/santaniere, if you are able to share the results and related stuff."
I study CSE. I have a lot of interest in computer since I was a child.Department faculties with better knowledge based education is needed..Lack of space and lack of playing field is a problem.Residential semester is most enjoyable.Very small place for a renowned private University is something to be ashamed of.In hope of seeing an actual CAMPUS. Only God and BRACU itself knows whether it is being met or not.Some faculties are the best and most of them are good. 
The bond between versities are never found in Bangladesh. We can see syllabus changes almost in every versity. if we talk about the public vs private the concept and circular are quite different but if the contents are same then it will help the students  i guess The educational quality of the versity is quite good but the student taking tendency is a great matter of concern.the way versity is taking students its becoming hard to maintain schedule and faculties are becoming tired as well cannot provide equal attention towards student.
marks distribution is good but paper checking is not that well. But i feel we can study here with a fixed pattern and there is a fixed schedule for everything which is good.
"BBS because BBA is my University Subject, The good thing includes achievements and facilities. Poor campus. Strong course structure. "
Library facility is very good but there is a problem collection of books. Available books are very less for some subjects.
No proper campus and so I hate to study here because it is very crowdy. No space is found so I do not like it
"I am from English Department. I chose it because I like English and it is a multipurpose subject.Fees and facilitiesexcessive rulesDisciplinepractice of excessive rulesQuality, dedication, commitment and improvement. Some are being satisfied and some are not.Teachers are standard and facilities are being improving.Not really"
"With the help of practicals, students are able to understand all the concept. So it is also good."
"CSE,Its close to my home and is good for engineering. No campus and very crowded.Faculties are very helpful. No proper campusSome are being satisfied but its taking too long.They are very helpful."
Education has become too expansive and lack research based activites are main problems.
Exam pattern and marks distribution are excellent but sometimes there are some errors in paper checking.
"Because of unavailability of transportation system, attending the class in time become very hard"
"University faculties are pretty interactive, But it all depends on the student to gain as much as knowledge he can from the teacher. Teachers are punctual and very helpful during exams time."
"Brac University is top ranked university in the country at present and also best option for CSE. Lack of a campus is very disturbing.

I can’t even find a place to sit or stand before or in between or after classes. The fact that it is the top most ranked university in the country."
"excellent simply superb. no ragging, women are free and there is so many modern lab facilities. i love it here in private far better than so called public"
"My experience in this University is very bad and stressful, also not organised. The system is not good enough."
Extracurricular activities are good and provide a good platform.
"the faculties are upto the mark, so are our subject ciricullum. Love this university even though private is neglected."
Private universities are for those who have a lot of money and so most of the people cannot study here
Brac University is crowded place. Want a big campus. Very good at education system. But nothing else is good.
"I am from BRAC University and i am in cse department.
My dream is to be a software engineer.A good education system.Yes.
Every university in our country has to adopt tough laws to exclude rags."
Politics in the university is sick. There is also ragging. It's all sick here in public. the private have more freedom than the public
"cse because of its versatility subject, campus is too small , lack of scholarships, campus size, good academic and social support. "
"Completed CSE. The course work was very touching. Inefficiencies of the authority. I had better expectation, but they were not satisfied. Overall good."
The course content is great. I can learn so much from it. it is very practical oriented.
"Achievements, Feed,pre advising, advising, Famous, High fees without facilities "
BRAC university there is good interaction with the students. Teachers in this university can deliver the lectures effectively. There is good punctuality in this university.
"Feels crowded and more like a coaching center.Useful career direction, crowded Own campus, innovative study, more practical knowledge oriented rather than theoritical Old ones are better."
I have no words to say about Brac University library facilities. Simply awesome.
The content of course should be increase with depth.
My route does not have a bus transport system so I find it difficult to go to my university so I am very much in need of a transport system.
Providing scholarship will be a great help in the way of my graduation
The university lacks proper resources. It has no environment to study in .The resources provide here are not enough   
"The faculties are good it , but faculties do not want to  consider the ideas of students ."
"I study in Computer Science and Engineering
Faculties, Distance, Open Credit system is understandable. Experienced teacher in industry is not bad, not good."
Practical work insome labs are not upto the marks. Authority doesn't listen to us.
"My unversity's examination pattern, marks distribution, paper checking is good. This are the things that I was looking for."
"As per libraries, few books are not available and in computer library there are hardly 5 PCs working."
"I am from CSE. Basically I want to learn about cse for exploring it's vast field.An university's reputation, educational quality matters most.Lack of space and Educational quality is a matter of concern.With the Lack of space for students ,I am not satisfied at all.Teachers are friendly."
It will provide us various books to increase our knowledge or to understand the concept because it is good
Needs to improve the education style.They should put more education pressure.
Mid term exam formats can be changed.
Examination pattern is good but mcq paper checking marks are not correct sometimes.
"Subject: Applied Chemistry or Genetic Engineering.
Fees should be like public varsities.
I am looking for some facilities which wont count on any specific community but for all. 
Dhaka University
North South University
Chittagong University
Jahangirnagar University      Applied chemistry or genetic Engineering because both have research facilities and I want to invent something new and beneficial for people which is connected to chemistry or biology.     My University will give me confidence to do anything. I hope my University will never be a reason of my discomfort on anything.  "
Library is vast and has got wide variety of books . But I think more number of specimen copies of books should be made available
Excellent lectures are delivered by faculties and all faculties are very punctual. They are very good in their field.
KUET is not bad. But can be better with proper applications.
labs are good but experiments are not very informative. Less time and more pressure doesn't let us know the depth.
"CSE department is my department. I'm in this department because I love cse.  Fees and Facilities,  Grading and Campus Facilities, Lab Facilities Grading System and Advising System Expected is fine. I have a Good CGPA but  not satisfied I badly need a campus. "
My opinion about my university is that I feel that my university is the best among all the others
Content of course is more than enough to get the basics of that particular subject.
I  want to participate in extra carricular activities but i can't take part in those activities because of my studies.
Content of the course is good. We like to study in Diffodil University.
Along with tuition fees we had to pay library fees too in every semester. Library fees should count basis year not per semester.
Private universities are better than public but they're just homeless. Also the private have more achievements than the public.
All are good except paper checking. It should be improved for the betterment of the university
"Well... all the books are not avilable . If they are in library , books are in less number and strength of student are large."
"The university education system, must be improved and we need affordable tuition fees too. It is increasing every year."
lab practical work help us to learn the things properly and evalution is also very necessary as it helps us to retain concepts
Lecturer are punctual and can interact them easily in every University. 
"Needs some improvement in edfucation, campus, facilites, faculties, quality. Yes, in everything"
Teaching techniques are good on every university. Average i can say overall as they are not sufficient in everything.
It is very good to be studying in a private university because of their modern method of teaching.
Learning must be emphasized based on projects and practical activities. Most often our courses are structed in such a way that due to constants quizzes and exams we don't get the time to focus on projects.
"Education system and environment is good, faculties deliver the lectures in the best way they can and we find it easy to understand. They help us whenever we need any academic support."
In my University interaction between students and faculties is good. Lecture is delivered in time and also the faculties are very punctual.They are very helpful and also want us to get good marks so they always give their best.
the content of the course is knowledgeable and also very interesting
some of the faculties don't know how to behave otherwise it is good. we dont have good communication among faculties
University performance is Excellent in projects . the private have more achievements than the public in competitions.
Subject & Campus is a huggeeeee problem. TARC was the best. The MNS courses are horrible. My expectation is to have a good career and i can tell the satisfaction after achieving it.
Civil Engineering Bangladesh University i read. I was always fascinated by the building and their structures. I want to know more of them. That's why my choice is civil engineering. Positive surroundings and great faculties.
Knowledge and depth of the course is good but while coming to the material it's not upto the mark.
My family is not financially able to pay such a high amount that private Universities  demands.
The tuition fee is an extremely important factor. We need affordable tuition fees and scholarships to be able to study inprivate universities.
course content is knowledgeable here in the privates
University must be serious about the student's success. Our university is more focused on admitting students but not in how what they're receiving it.
lab and practical work are  good in a way and I love it so much 
Some of the lecturers have a bad teaching style but others are very good and catch your attention . Good use of theory and practical
BRAC UNIVERSITY ECE is the best teacher. Childhood dream to become an Engineer. People and clubbing unity and bonding is good. Restrictions are imposed properly. 
"We need Transportation system to make our journey safe, comfortable and affordable"
The more examinations the more it is better for us.
"I am From BRAC UNIVERSITY and my Department is CSE. The contents of CSE seemed nice to me and the career prospects attracted me. My university focused on research and my department had a really fine set of faculties. Most of our alumnus are in very good position. No campus. However, it took the highest amount of tuition fee in Bangladesh! They intake too many students for CSE. My expectations was my university will make its intake strict and limited. But they didn't do it. Faculties were really nice and qualified. However, during my last period, many faculties went abroad and they took so many junior faculties. Due to lack of a campus, facilities were very few. Faculties were really nice and qualified."
Our learning material is quite great and unique. But the class learning content and Examination Question content is not matched in some cases.
content tought is not sufficient for us. More topics needs to be added.
"exam pattern is good, very well marks distribution and paper checking varies from teacher to teacher. the private have more achievements"
If i rate the university facility and education quality i would give 4 out of 5.
Experience on private university is not good. But we could improve it through proper narturing.
"I am from Department of English & Modern Language, NSU. It’s one of the best university in Bangladesh with all the best facilities."
In our University we have good teaching delivery. Our faculties are very experienced and has a good interaction with students.
The quality of education is not good at all. The faculties are average.
"Microbiology is my subject of study. 
I always find myself charmed with the informations that how microorganisms are so much related to our bodies and lifes though we can't feel them until we get infection. So I choose this department to know more about the biological science. By their stranded level of education policies. Of course the 1st problem of BRAC University as everyone knows is very small campus with a over population. The system of teaching. I really don't like such a small place with so much sound pollution. I hardly find any place there to sit and to have some times for study not even in library. I just need our new campus so soon and that's all. It's a 50/50 thoughIf possible make a foot over bridge between the 2 buildings. We the students really suffer a lot including the guards who try to help the students to cross the roads safely to cross the road as local buses are always there and we all know how unsafe it is."
exam pattern and marks distribution is very well procedure
The university should provide us with some libarties .
knowledge is maximum gained by reading books also the faculties explain depth if we are interested to know about it.
Maintained punctuality. Good lecture delivery is art of Dhaka University.
"BBS, as I want to do a corporate jobEducation quality not having a campus and good library with enough outside books They always try to be updated not concern enough about activities outside academic I expect good academic education with enough outside activities most of them are well qualified and do their job in a way they should do itAll of our universities should try to do research based works rather than thaking exams in a traditional way."
The course content of my university of my department are very useful to the sudents for physical activity and improvement of knowledge.
The public universities are very convenient with their own transport and low tuition fees. The private universities need to provide these features too.
Content of courses are average. We expect more facilities.
I felt its better because there is no problem from library facilities. Rajshahi University has good environment also.
"EEE is my department. I chose this subject to persue a career in energy and machinery. Also the Achivements, facilitiesand  reputation is high. It is a great place to chill and study. Teacher and university should encourage more to do research and projects."
I am from Law. I was Interested in knowing the legal system of our country. Subjects and it's reputation is most important for universities. Definitely the campus is the main issue.. The grading system needs to be improved. a bigger campus is required. Tuition fees is too high.
"Fees &  Achievements of Daffodil University, Jahangirnagar University, EWU is great.ENGLISH is my major.
Always be fascinated by the Language and Literature. Better facilities, guidance, improvement in skills. Belonging from a mid-lower class family higher education is like an white elephant. Had to work so hard just to reach to this point. Just for some unfortunate reasons, could got a chance of admission in a public University. Why does the reality had to be so painful and depressing. Life has turned into a joke. That's all I had to share.
"
"THE Interaction of teacher with students is satisfied, lecture delivery good,punctuality always on time."
It's good when compare with my Biotech lectures and teaching activities.
"I study CSE, As I thought it was my passion Subject. Firstly,tuition costs are rising at alarmingly high rates. Secondly too much students for a little campus and lastly have no field to play. Quality of education, Faculty and research facilities are the best.The fee is too high.I am satisfied with my university. The faculties are Good and friendly."
My department is very good and I like my university so much because it helps me in a lot of ways to remain motivated .
This is one of the worse experiences i have ever had. I have had several breakdowns (i had experienced none before i went to this uni) because of the self-centered nature of the lecturers and university. No support what so ever. When i inquire about support I receive nothing. I am thinking of transferring to a different university because the experience has been so bad. DO NOT GO TO THIS university
"Fees and achievements are important for a university. I am in North south University, i am doing my MBA, cause I want to be a graduate and i want to get a good job"
The semesters are awesome and quick. university has provide best faculties for us . very satisfied.
"It sucks, I hate it so much it’s so lonely and boring and there’s not enough work to do. There’s nothing to do in the university."
My university experience had been amazing so far I am slightly over halfway through my first year and I have already made lot of new friends and met lots of new people from all over the world. My social life has never been better and the work load although hefty is manageable allowing me to get the most out of my university experience and learn the most I possibly can.
University should have a good campus. Many more of them are not good in it.
Overall the quality of education is the best. The faculties are very friendly.
We have a good library with all facilities which is why all the students are happy
I mostly enjoy lab work. The more lab work the better it is.
teaching is good but some lecturers are showing partiality between south people and north people
Lab evaluations are very strict but learning is not satisfactory. Contents are very hard to understand. Faculties are not interested to give a clear view about a particular topic.
I am from CSE.It has a high market demand and seemed a good choice.Achievements of the university is the most important.There are too many students in our small campus.Good Facilities required.
Library facilities are very good. No issues
BRAC University library has huge collection of books from different authors. Which is knowledgable.
"I am loving university, both the social side and my classes. I am learning to be independent and making friends and memories. My course is exactly how i would expected it to be and i am loving living away from home."
Pattern of examination is good but paper checking is not at all going in a good way.
Faculties should be open-minded for the students. Most of them don't help us.
review of my university is overall good and which is why I love to study here
It is very nice and timings of library is good 5/5. BRAC University's library is my favourite place.
"Mechanical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering all type of engineering is depending on university's teaching techniques. Environment and everything co operational education in Bangladesh is not satisfied. Need to change the mentality and stop showing off. "
"CSE because its the Best private university in Bangladesh for studying .transportation problem: University bus is too early or too late for students like me who lives in narayangonj 
time schedule :I have to start for university at 6:30 for class at 9:30 and my class schedule is like 9:30-10:50 , 12:30-1:50,3:30-4:50 so I have to stay outside from 6:30 am to 9:00 pm
so I don't get enough time to study at home. faculties are friendly it doesn't have a campusI learnt new things here and I am working harder these days than before. they are really helpful and friendly.please help the students who are facing problems in the university"
Completing CSE. Study was satisfactory at BRAC University.
"Teaching is excellent,but lecture delivery is not up to the mark.Punctuality is good"
"IT IS GOING GOOD in this university, experience with friends. friends are really what matters to me"
Our university is so costly and so I cannot study here and so I need to have  a sound scholarship.
Universities are good enough in Bangladesh. In this country all university try to keep balance.
The Unversity is quite good .The quality of it depends upon teacher and their experience.
It's good but we don't find the books because their are much less number of books.
"Class and quality, No campus, open credit system, Management, Friendly campus, Used to be great now average"
It is statisfactory beacuse faculties are very creative. we are getting new experiences
"CSE is my subject.this is one of the best University with a lots of facilities and achievements It's very costly and there's no campus to hang aroundTARC
They try to teach you to live by yourself there which is unique.Not having a campusMy expectations is that they should make me skilled/upgrade at my field of work 
They are giving all the opportunity to do so the rest is up to meMost of them are good
There's some bad faculties tooIn my opinion the grading system is kind of tough for us"
"CSE department and choose this field of area when I first started coding and find it interesting. Achievement and reputation and education quality that's in the air Space, falling education quality, bad teacher recruitment."
yeah! the education system is good. Well some of the teacher are not teaching well but the schedule of the university are superb. And university asked feedback from us .that is really helpful
good enough if the Private Universities have a campus and value in the job market.
"I am from CSE Department, I want to be involved in this field in the future with software engineering at its core. We have Reputation, scholarship.There is a Lack of a permanent open campus.Its quality of education is very good..Selecting courses during semester breaksThey are working on a new campus and hopefully will be done by 2021 Very good."
Horrible things in the university include the grading syste. There is no decency and smoking is like everywhere. At least provide a good space for us who just want to study
everything is good except the expenditures. They cost too much. They should at least consider scholarship for people with cgpa above 3.
"Economics and Social Science. Development studies had always fascinated me and economics seemed like a good foundation to build upon.Subject and achievements.The influx of students every semester makes the campus crammed but that's unavoidable. The coursework is rigourous and quite stressful.Most of the faculties are helpful, be it coursework, research or advice on future prospects.The short semesters.My expectations from my university are mostly to provide me with the resources I require to further my education. So far, I haven't been disappointed. The university acquires books for me if the library does not possess them and our department helps us acquire datasets when we need them."
University in Bangladesh has lack of  security and so we feel very much unsecured
Public universities are very good teaching and management but too much load on student and working hours. I studied at BUET. The pressure of study is higher than other university when i compare it with my other university friends.
There is nothing good about private universities.They don't have good faculties or any facilities.
Achievments and quality of education are the plus points of the university.
Reading facilities are excellent.but only limited books are available .so books should be increased. there should be more ways of learning creativity.
The tuition fee is very costly and so for this reason scholarship is very important for me so that I can afford studying.
THEY IS NO PROBLEM WITH EDUCATION BUT THERE IS DEFINITELY PROBLEM WITH CAMPUS AND FACILITIES.
"The university is painful experience becau there aren't good opportunities for women, there should be some space. The conjusted lift and every place is conjusted. it's very upsetting."
I am from pharmacy department. Bigger facilities are required. Not getting expected grades is demoralizing .Small campus with over Population is a problem.Teachers are Friendly and the provide us with maximum time ..
"Library facilities are good, it maintains silence there and makes good environment to study but sometimes it goes very strict which is not required according to me."
Brac University Faculties are supportive.  We learn properly about every topic.
Militery Institute of Science and Engineering's library facilty is very good. 
We don't have a proper transport system and so the cost is very high for my transport.
there should not be negative marking because many students are getting more than they deserve. i hate private university grading system
Courses are very knowledgeable. Some subjects do not have dedicated material like books available.
"Interaction between students and faculties is good .The lectures delivery is fine, and their punctuality is good too"
Teaching delivery is good but it is better to reduce there speed of lecture delivery to understand the student better.
My experience at South East University is not bad. I got scholarship also.
"Well appointed workshops, classrooms with reasonable IT provision. Library has laptop computers that can be signed out by students as well as desktop computers. Online digital library available as well as hard copy literature. Canteen serves nice food on site.Supportive tutors deliver interesting lectures. Staff are approachable and will find time to give additional guidance if asked. I'm very much enjoying the course although it is very hard."
By road accidents in public transport my friend died. Lack of University transport system is the reason behind my friend's death.
library facilities are good . Every book is available in the library
Good and Strict these two words we can use about Dhaka University.
Exams conducting is very good .but paper correction is very bad.
"The teaching material is excellent, far better than what I experienced in two face-to-face universities. Tutor support is also excellent in my experience."
"CSESubject Not having proper campus, too much student, labs needs improvement Most faculties are good Not enough space , noisy , huge lift loneMaking a good environment for study Most faculties are good enough but facilities needs improvement "
everything is good for teacher but not for students in the university
Private university's lab is very much helpful than public. private unoversities really seek excellence.
"For studying in the most famous and well known private university, I need a high amout of money so I prefer scholarship should be given."
Our Faculty's lecture delivery and punctuality was good but the interaction with students was not good.
University transport service must ensure pickup and drop off points from through out the city.
"The material provided in this university is depth of course, The courses in this university is knowledgeable"
We have classes on different hours of the day. So bus transportation is required through out the day.
"We need affordable educational fee, scholarship and tuition fee from all universities."
"I was fascinated by engineering machines and stuffs so I chose EEE at Khulna University of Engineering and Technology. The teacher and also the achievements of the university was good I heard. So, I picked that institute. The lack of a good campus is always there in out mind. Some times one need to rest and relax from study but university had failed to provide us that. The ethics and the people are extremely polite. The 3 semester system in a year is disturbing that's what I think. Because of that I get more quizes, less combined vacations. The teacher will be moderate about the marking and the scholarship systems should be upgraded. The teacher are much much liberal but there are always some flaws. "
content is good enough. We need more good contents.
"BRAC UNIVERSITY is my University. I study in Comuper Science and Engineering because I was good at mathematics.The Residential Semester is not having a campus of its own and cramming too many students in there.It has An encouraging study environment . Though it deteriorated in the later period of my study.Thereis no campus It does not have a good administration, and other student facilities. The faculties  are not that satisfactory.Some were pretty good. Especially at the early stage of my study at the university. But the rest were not up to mark.Some were pretty good. Especially at the early stage of my study at the university. But the rest were not up to mark."
Zoology. no option to choice other subject achievement don’t face any problem Don't know nothing to get good education all r very goodi just want a good job after completingmy graduation
Our University must recruit international faculties so that we will be able to learn in a more effective way. Our Library need to be more enriched.
CSE is my department because I love coding.I got my preffered subject. There is no space in the university.The Girls are 10/10. The space isnt enough. I expect more oportunities should be provided by the university . Overall my university is not that bad.
"Returning the question paper after the exams to be expected,because to clear and clarify the doubts regarding particular subjects."
It is very good learning in this university. expecting more knowledge. we expecct more motivation and performances.
punctuality and lecture is good in  private universities even though it's on a small room but interaction isn't good.
This is the best in our university because there is no other university which takes seriously for practical work. Lab activities are well.
yeah Quite well library in university but some of the books are not available. the university needs to provide a place to eat .
"The library should be the strength of a university. It is awesome that we have this perfectly. we can really learn practically. However, we lack open space and also a relaxing place also."
I have studied ESS at BRAC University. I always admired economics more than others. Quality and reputation of this university with faculties is good. People do not treat everyone the same. Absurd environment with best people. Campus is not so good. Getting quality education and to some extent. They are being satisfied. One of the best University. Tution fee of the universities should be minimal irrespective of private or public. People should get the chance of higher education based on their merit and not on their money.
"good,they work very hard for us and so we are very lucky to have such nice faculties and also friends."
"Architecture Department of BRAC University is my favourite place. I thought i could explore my creativity through designing buildings with my ideas. Moreover, this subject is beyond just sticking to the textbook. Achievements and Facilities of Grading system is very poor. Especially some faculties are really biased towards some specific students. The campus, the security, student facility, the environment is so so.There’s no specific thing that I dislike about my university. I would like to graduate without any academic issues and i expect my university will be helpful towards me about ensuring me my certificates on time. There are students who have faced some issues during collecting their certificates that is why I’m not sure whether I will face any difficulties or not. I would say the faculties are very helpful and co-operative. But some of them are biased which is problem."
Sometime it is irrelevent with the ongoing courses. All Bangladeshi University should develop.
Our university is well planned and the syllabus of the courses are also up to the mark.We get good grades and also wish to have a brighter future.
university management is extordinary but some of the teacher is very bad. also we dont have campus actually.
Exam pattern is completely different. The entire exams are objective oriented resumbling the education in abroad. My review is 5/5
"Too much tuition fee, private universities need to setup some system of canteen and transport also."
Extra curricular activities also help students to divert their mind from their study for some time. University plays an important role in this task.
Course materials are very usefull to students. Dhaka University campus is Excellent.
I like this very much because every subject is linked up with real life situations and every thing in the subject is useful
labwork is horrible. We need better lab facilities
"Exam pattern is up to the mark and the Cgpa depends on the various marks distributions like ca, mte etc which is very nice as compare to other institutions. Paper checking does not depend on length of ques but on the material which is the best part of it."
A bigger campus with better facilties are required. The number of new students intake should be lessened.
The way of teaching is good but the class time is not enough.
I study in CSE because its my passion . There is no campus to breath.Its educational curriculum is great but this University takes more students than its capacity every semester. I thought University will guide me in the right path. So far I am satisfied to study here.
"CSE. I chose to study CSE because I was interested to learn about Computer Science.Fees and Facilities.Mainly there are problems i have regarding the Faculty issues. The campus is beautiful and people there are very nice and polite.The fact that departments don't let us know, before the semester begins, about which faculties we are being provided.I am expecting to see improvements regarding the teacher issues. Better effort in improving their way of teaching.most of them are polite, except for few."
Electrical and Electronic Engineering Is Crucial For a University. Environment is horrible. No Session block is great. expected to graduate within the time period and i got it.They are too good and cooperative . faculties were cooperative
"Teachers are Knowledge and good ,but depth of course is not good enough. Course material are not upto the mark."
The course content of my university improves my knowledge. it enhances the my practical knowledge.
Due to averge quality faculties the quality of education is also Average in private universities.  Facilities in Private Universities needs to be improved.
I don't like the nagetive marking system. Apart from that everything is great
I am Studying in Cse department BRAC University. I had no idea about campus and faculties could be like this. I expect best education with good environment but for given time the syllabus is  huge and there is hardly any space for waiting. Don’t like the trimester system. 
"The distance has become a big issue. We cannot attend the university on a daily basis, We need a transport system to solve this issue."
i have LESS TIME FOR STUDY ...i have LESS TIME FOR PAPER ATTEMTING...LESS TIME FOR EVERY THING ....LESS KNOWLEGE.....LESS DEPTH OF COURSE .....BUT PROPER COURSE MATERIAL ACCORDING TO EXAM
Average in a word and opportunities are less here which is an issue
Almost each and every books is there.But the time limit for keeping book is too much shorted.
"In CSE department, there is a lack of good options when choosing faculties during pre-advising. Most of the faculties are very supportive. Compus is very conjusted . Too many people cramp at a very small space."
"The most important things to me are regular and easy access to facilities and getting support from academic staff. The university already offers exceptional, personal support from academic and non-academic staff, and we’re able to book laboratories and specialist equipment regularly. I would like to see more opportunities for placements and professional experiences"
Interaction is good but not with mostly male lecturers. Punctuality is maintained by everyone but lecture delivery not peak quality.
I think a safe and comfortable transport system will make the University more attractive
Learing new that's great to me. Chittagong University gave me that opportunity. 
This is really a good thing that events happen in our university regularly but they must be announced early so that every student can prepare themselves for participation because sometimes we get to know about most of the events when they have already been conducted. So announcement must be there.
CSE many job fields will be open + coding is funSubject and achievementsNo Campus so lot of travelling from one building to the otherTARCroad crossing Expectations include a more lenient form of communication with the faculties and in many cases these are fulfilled but not in allMost of them are nice 
"Sometimes only book is available for some subjects. 
And it is reserved. Should be open for all students."
teaching activities of our university is good. i am satisfied with it. we need more performance in labs
CSE is getting priority in job market. No campus but friendly teaching system is available in BRAC university. 
This university is number 1 in terms of extracurricular activities and in encouraging students to participate at their comfort levels.
Paying this high amount tuition fee becomes a mental pressure for me. We need waiver.
"I found cse interesting Subject, AchievementsToo many students, Its reputation Campus We need less students"
I have completed Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering. I wanted to have some fun. The green campus love for 157 acresfinding myself mixed feelings: hall life and politics highly satisfied corrupted. Education must be disseminated through action and everywhere. A graduate first learn to be humble and give accolades to the surrounding and environment.
library facilities need to be improve by bringing some more books . also there isn't a peaceful spot to stuy and think. people are making love everywhere.
I'm from CSE department. I choose this because my parents wanted me to be a computer engineer. Achievements and facilities are so so. There is lack of proper campus. Standard of education is high. Mandatory 70% attendance is their one of the good rule. Not satisfied over all.
Some of the faculties are not well experienced but they are interactive and helpful and punctual.
Quite a lot of events are organized and students have a all round growth which is a nice thing.
"everything was good regarding to university but, some lecturers don't have grip on the subject and lag in the teaching"
"some time lab is not proper working , some teacher's practical knowledge is less on the other side evaluations is not that much good"
Lab work is properly covered in the labs by the teacher and evaluations help to learn more practical knowledge in depth.
The Universities need better lift facilities. Ofter there are huge queue outside the univerity building during the class hours.
CSE. HUGE Reputation Having no campus is the major problem now. It's faculties and my friendsNo space. And too much student. I don't like chaosNo expectations from them. 
all are excellent and so I like my university a lot and I am studying in the best university
Private universities are  quite great and unique. They are safer than public universities.
My subject is CSE and I find it is very hard and my university cannot give proper knowledge
good but marks are not given properly. grading system is overally horrible.
"I love my university, events it is providing, great opportunity for students to learn more instead of just sitting and listening to the lecture. I would recommend it to anyone"
It is very interesting to study in my University. I enjoy a lot here. All the people are very nice to me and so I am very happy here.
content provided by you is excellent so that we learnt more and more about that particular subject
Till now the universities of Bangladesh need improvements in both academic and non-academic criteria. Providing standard and quality education among students but the cost is so high. 
Completeing my study on EEE i learnt so many thing in Electronics and Electricity.
Lab activities are good but not satisfactory in explaining point of view.
Labs are very interesting in North South University. It is helpful to know the knowledge.
every one can tell depth of course but most of them only give notes
"very good teaching facilities, lecture given are fruitful and faculties are punctual"
content is very knowledgable and gives us huge knowledge of every subject
its booring. faculties need to be creative. we need more motivation . our labs need more technology and attention.
"I have really enjoyed my time here, the courses are really interesting, the people that work are here are very nice and know what they're doing, so I could recommend this university to future students."
The laboratory of our university provides us a good knowledge about practicals. The faculties have a very good command over the topic.
So many students drop out from universities for higher tuition fee and no scholarship every year.
"There is nothing about a University that doesn't matter. We need education facilities, clubs, canteen, library and proper lab equipments."
"pUBLIC UNIVERSITIES are showing partiality between THE RICH AND THE POOR , THE GOOD AND THE BAD."
Private universities are not affordable without a proper tranportation and also without scholarship and so it is very important to have a proper scholarship and also a good transport.
The problem with unversities is that they very strcitly evalute marks.
"I study in Brac University and my department is Cse. because of i am interested in it sector.  The cost is increasing day by day, but their services and study quality is not sufficient and enough."
"CSE department in American International University of Bangladesh. I chose this department following my passion. Facilities and as i didn’t get my preferred subject in public engineering universities. The Campus is too small. The ACM community and contests. Nothing to love, nothing to hate. To learn. Till now, very good. They are helpful and friendly."
staff is showing partiality between north indians and south indians which is a great problem because  discrimation prevails here
Its not effective and satisfactory in terms of lecture delivery by all the teacher. Most of them are not experienced so it has become a problem.
"I am from BRAC UNIVERSITY, BBA . I selected BBA because I wanted to learn about business.BBA because I wanted to learn about business. Open credit system in most important part of an university."
"It has been very pleasant. I've passed all my modules so far and I really like the tutors and other staff. The workload was surprising but it was doable so long as you're not lazy about it. For the first year ,if you have good time management ,you wont need to stress over staying up late to finish projects ,which I assume will be different in the later years ."
IN MY OPINION PRIVATEUNIVERSITIES ARE GOOD. THEY HAVE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE BUT THEY FOCUS ON MONEY RATHER THAN IMPROVEMENT.
"CSE
Programming & CodingSubject & AchievementsCampus and FeesAchievementsLots of StudentsAverageGoodWorst pre advising system"
"My experience in this University is very bad and stressful, also not organised. The system is not good enough."
Teachers are not giving depth of course . They are only trying to cover there work .
All are enough if Universities apply all the system and rules properly.
"our university is good in terms of lecture delivery,interaction and punctuality"
"Dhaka university is far better than other university when coming to the exam pattern,marks disturbation and while coming to paper checking no biased corrections equal to all."
BRAC UNIVERSITY CSE is where I study. Enthusiastic in cse . The environment and Administration is Too much secured To make some places for the students for roaming and I think it is essential.It is Very much intimate and providing enough facilities. Faculties should be open-minded for the students.
"I am studying at BRAC university. It was my Parents' decision.Reputation and rating is the best part of the university.there are Lack of resources . Lack of space. Inexperienced facultiesEnvironmentToo crowded. Admission exam too easy. Good learning environment. Helpful, career oriented education. Learning soft skills. I'm not satisfied.Okay. Some are good."
"I Studied Psychology at Dhaka University. Based on current demand and future opportunities. Fees, convenience, renowned acclaimed, Transportation, Dorm rent, Systematic pre-planned governance of the university, where students don't face any hassle. I think the tuition fee is high as well as the times when the university ask for extra charges for commodity. My expectation is that university reduce the tuition fee above all. This is not being satisfied to the extend i expect them do so. They are friendly, helpful, and care-giving. "
it is good for refreshment.  And for this reason I can easily pass my leisure time in the campus
"Super, the extracurricular activities held in BRAC university. So that student can show the efforts in other fields."
Extracurricular is something that motivates us. Such more activities should be introduced.
Stuying CSE at BRAC University. It's something i haven't learned before and i found this program very intuitive and interesting. It was mainly due to it's reputation and many remarkable achievements. Poor infrastructure and planning. Not enough space or facilities. Surrounded my cheap and tasty food stores. Too many students. Completely change everything. Some are extremely good while others should just leave.
I think the practicals should be of 2 hours. That's enough I think. Rest is fine. Also we should be rewarded with certificates
"CSE is my department and  I chose it because my passion is in coding. There is no campus, too much pressure in 4months(actually 3months) semester . Full syllabus in final is very much hectic so the syllabus should only be the contents that will be taught after mid."
3 hours practical is so long. It should be of 2 hours only.
"Interaction is very less ,when it comes to lecture delivery.It is still fine but the co cordination is not there between the lectures."
I am from CSE Department. Because i love to code. Shortage of space in campus. Faculties are not enough. More students. A large library and should have more facilities to do research. Awesome.
BRAC UNIVERSITY CSE i like most. My passion is CSE. Faculties and Reputation was my concern when want to admit in any university. No proper campus our university owned. My expectation was to get a job after graduation and it was fulfilled. Very good and professional it's important to have a good campus.
Our university is very good but in terms of interaction of faculties with students is not at all fair because they interact with only students understands his/her teaching. They don't make remaining students to understand the topic.
It is not appropriate to comment over Bangladesh Universities. They are mixed. Finding out over which one is good and which one is bad very difficult.
Brilliant but Financially insolvent students are not getting the chance to study here because of high tuition fees. It needs to lessen the amount.
Tution fees are increasing every year with the new comers. In this pandemic situation of Covid19 some of the private universities didn't less tution fees or help by raising student financial fund.
teaching is good some lecturers are showing partiality between south people and north people
everything is good but when coming to some lecturers who dont have a good grip on subject becomes and issue . They dont behave well with students and  dont even teach all the concepts in the subject.
"A lot could be done to improve the environment around the campus (especially public universities). 
Quality of education is degrading. Education is fine because of it's reputation but needs to work on the infrastructure. "
"Exam pattern Very good, Marks distribution good but sometimes disappointing, paper checking OK"
Very poor education in private universities because often they do not have good faculties and facilities .
I study in the best University because it provides me a lot of facilities
After examinations the question paper should be given back.
Chance to go and enjoy should be given. I think it should be off when any activity like One India is there to go and enjoy. Otherwise everything is good.
coming to the courses these are very well planned... and it all depends on the lectures.
Not all the faculties are teaching well but it's enough. With better teaching we could understand better.
University Progress Not Good. Register should be more helpful.
for some subjects like maths and english(passage writing) the time duration neds to increase
"I like communication activity is classes,courses are good."
University transport service should pickup and drop off students all day long. Time of classes are different with every single students.
"My department is Environmental science and management.   For huge number of students it seems like that our campus is getting smaller day by day. So space has become our big problem now a days.
Relationship Between students and honorable teachers is so amazing  .There is a  bookshop(Jalil shop) where extra Money for all the books,pen and study related anythig is taken.      Human can not be satisfied, and im a Human. If i talk about the teachers then Some of them are very good. But sometimes some of them are not. 
And if i talk about the facilities, we need more"
The library is absolutely fine.  All books are there but the thing is that the time limit is very less and  we have to return the book that we have issued very fast
"in our University, our teacher's lecture delivery depends on teacher's knowledge, punctuality is good. Examination system is satisfacory."
The exam pattern of our university is good and good paper checking. Faculties are not biased.
"I want to be a software developer. So choiced subject CSE. Behavious of the registrar office employees is different. Good campus,nice environment. They are not satisfied at all. Some are good ,some are rude. Campus is needed for a university. Fees of university should be affordable by the student."
We need fields to play sports and relax our minds.Unfortunately most of the private universities do not have playing ground. A playing field must made mendatory for all Private universities.
We need 24 hour residential facilities .
"I am from BRAC Business School. I have chosen this department because I am a commerce background student, who is passionate regarding Business related studies. It has a great Reputation and Excessive academic pressure.
It has a very rigid grading policy. It's ranking is very high. My expectation is so that I can get a good job and I will understand it after completing graduation."
No idea about the extracurricular activities. We need more.
I am from BRAC UNIVERSITY.I am from BBA department.I like the bondinf between the people in Residential semester.There is not enough space in our main campus. We need a good campus with good line of faculties. I'm sort of satisfied.Few of the faculties were amazing.
Perfect University is Private Ones
all activities are good. but htere is lack of quality education. anywaysn lots of stuff to do except studying and thats what i like most
Many students lost their life by using dangerous public transport because distance from home to universities sometimes is very far from each others.
Excellent faculties  but sometimes lack of books in libraries especially during exam times.
The library has insufficent number of books for all the students and so for this reason people visit the library so much
Everything with private universities are good. They provide all the best facilities.
extracurricular activities are also good and this helps us in future.
"Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) at BRAC University. Because I enjoy this course as well as I want to be a video game developer in future. I have received good reviews of CSE department and its courses that it is the best place to study for CSE with great faculties. Other than that, overall performance, environment and students interaction and activities with each other and of this University. Fees is very high. Agreed that we are given consultation hours, tutorial classes and all those extra help. Yet that's really too much and this money increases like for spring 2018 batch if suppose it is 85K, for summer 2018 it will probably rise to around 90K. So, money increases semester wise. Another huge problem is during the time of pre-advising & advising. In the time of pre-advising during our first 6 semesters specially, we could not always get our desired courses on desired time and even desired faculties from whom to study. We always had to compensate on one or two factors. There were limited seats & sections for an ample amount of students. Even time would clash with lab or other subjects which we have to fix and it takes huge time since seats get booked & adding or dropping courses sometimes take time because the survey gets hanged as well in both cases. I think this will continue later as well. In addition to that, if our pre-advising is not completed & we move to advising, we have to stand for hours since student to teacher ratio lets say only for CSE is 200:1 which results in slower server (server slows down in both cases of pre-advising and advising). Interacting students and helpful faculties, really good friends, enjoy classes, enjoy this course and useful workshops for my career related and club fairs, sometimes good food from outside all these are the best. Good time in TARC, Savar too. Too much chaos of students every where and hardly any place to sit during free times especially in canteens. Currently, I am satisfied since my expectations as of now are having great workshops related to my career apart from good studies. In sum not really good university as expectations are. Thank You for counting my review in advance & welcome as well."
I have loved the uni so far. My classes have all been stimulating and interesting. For instance I have never done biology in school but I took a biology elective and it was hard but I loved learning new things
satisfactory when it comes to education. horrible when it comes to campus. excellent when it comes to freedom.
I am really enjoying my private university experience because I like the politics free environment.
All lecturers are giving their best to teach the students perfectly so that the students don't face any problems. And so I am very proud  of it.
Without scholarship it wouild be extreamely hard for me to continue my undergraduate programme.
"depth of the course are depended on the level of student intake, course material is delivered after the class in UMS"
Distance is a big issue and so I think that it will be better if they have a proper transport system.
Again the university tests students of their ability to memorize stuff. Questions should emphasize more on concepts rather than testing brain's cramming storage house.
"University teaching here is very much dependent upon slides, though it is a easy way of teaching but still leaving some concepts unclear. Otherwise interaction with the teacher is good. Lecture delivery sometimes is not upto the mark and punctuality is fine."
I am from EEE because I like electronics. The faculties are good. Having a campus or not having it is not a problem.
"The course materials provided are good. However, the courses are too short."
"labs are interesting and helpful for the knowledge. however, the theory faculties are really boring even though they are qualified."
Private universities are undoubtedly very strict and that's why there is always success.
More number of lab/practicals should be there to enhance practical knowledge in the University
Interaction is satisfying. Lecture delivery is Good. Punctuality is Excellent. 
The level of examination should be raised. Questions with reasoning must be included.
All things are good. I don't think any improvements are required.
It's very bad thing not showing answer of mcQ in exam. We dont jiged what is right and wrong where make mistake. 
I find my university fine in  a way because it is well disciplined and maintained
"good but there is more need of keeping books of general topics about social,politics , gk and other than related to subject so that we will get some knowledge about country related issues."
My Univeristy experience is average.in one term there should be only two major subjects based on numerical
I am doing my BBA in marketing. I chose marketing cause it’s easier than others Facilities There are class in the morning which is at 8:30 am. Largest green campus.There are no waiting room for the students outside the registre office. I have no expectations.
"I study in NORTH SOUTH UNIVERSITY in  Marketing Department. It has Good teacher members, Great campus environment, quality education. It is   first university in Bangladesh to receive ACBSP accreditation   .  Nepotism in advising  is seem. In some cases satisfied,  in very few cases not satisfied . Most of them were very much supportive. The administration should be more supportive towards the students    "
Here we are able to do every thing by our own with our faculties valuable support.
I FOUND THE COURSE IS GOOD BUT I THINK THERE IS NO PROPER COURSE MATERIAL
It is good to learn from labs but the lab instruments are not properly working.
"I dont like University, too much pressure unnecessirily.we also need space in the job market"
BRAC University BBA department is the worst. The quality of education is not right. No proper campus was unexpected as they promised. 
All activties are good. Lab activities are good. Education system is practical life oriented.
Sometimes systems at labs are screwed up .Otherwise everything is at their respected desk.
Lab or practical work is excellent and yes including evaluations also.
"I chose BBA department beecause BBA of Nsu is the best  among all private universities  of Bangladesh for reputation,Facilities ,Experienced,Smart & cool faculties,& mainly for providing  USA curriculum based quality education. It is Over populated and has Poor wifi and mobile network connection I have to suffer a lot During advising (like not getting expected course). For our grading method Education quality & Campus facilities Grading system, I expect that our university shouldn’t  pressurise much over us & advising should me more better. I love my university a lot.Despite having some problem we usually  face a lot,I admire that my university is one the best university in Bangladesh.It should be more better in every way"
BRAC UNIVERSITY is my university and my suject is CSE because I like to do programming. Education quality is good. Residential semester is also fun.Lack of space in campus is a problem for Learning more practical knowledge in my field.I could not fulfill this by studying there.They were well qualified and the facilities were enough.
BRAC UNIVERSITY is my university and I chose CSE for coding. I expected to learn much more but lecturers did not help enough.
The exam script checking is very strict. Often the faculties don't want to give good grades to the students.
The tuittion fee is too much. We cannot afford this amount. We need affordable tuition fees or scholarships. 
We lack a proper stransport system. Too much expenses outside the university for food and transport.
I can honestly say if wasn't being paid to be here would not come. Waste of time. Irrelevant and outdated information. have no concept of future innovation and the future only talk about the past. Can now see why university students are so out of touch when it comes to working in the real world as the information they get given at university is totally outdated and inapplicable to real-life scenarios.
More books should be provided and the issue period should be increased in Brac University. We want to know it throughly.
"BBA of Nsu is the best  among all private universities  of Bangladesh university reputation. Facilities ,Experienced,Smart and cool faculties, mainly for providing USA curriculum based quality education. Over populated. Poor wifi and mobile network connection, have to suffer a lot During advising (like nit getting expected course), finally our grading method. Education quality & Campus facilities Grading system. I expect that our university shouldn’t  pressurise much over us & advising should me more better. I love my university a lot. Despite having some problem we usually face a lot. I admire that my university is one the best university in Bangladesh. It should be more better in every way."
The university gives us various opportunities and exposure which helps us during our professional career.
Interaction is good but it should be more friendly. Apart from that rest is too perfect.
LAB IS VERY GOOD In the Private Universities
"I study at SUST. I am very much satisfied with teaching teacher in terms of iteraction,lecture delivery, punctuality etc."
I am from CSE department and I am not satisfied and so I do not like my university 
syllabus is more which required time ..it should b less so that student can proper concentrate getting the knowlegde instead of just covering the syllabus
Lab is good the Prof explains everything before the lab begins and the Lab Asst helps us during the experiments
"EEEC ourse distribution is good, Qualified professors makes it the best, Over pressure in education, Satisfied except a few facts like excessive students. grading system of the private University should be changed"
extracurricular activities are excellent and provides best platform to students.
A good and punctual university required. Where i could not find out any.
"BRAC UNIVERSITY Architecture. Because of building cool looking house models Architecture. Because of building cool looking house modelsFound Many people who shares same ideology Residential semester Too much buisness and commercial centric administration which in many ways heavily impacts the core point, the education itself.Got a degree. Im satisfied.Some good faculties and some awful. Poor facilities. Some good faculties and some awful. Poor facilities.  "
No proper campus and so I hate to study here because it is very crowdy
not a lot to say just really stressful and not a good experience. Timetables need to improve. If you are looking to sing your own music and concentrate on writing your own songs this is not the uni for you.
Universities are good but not too good. Our faculties improve the subject.
"staff and teacher members are always available for interaction, very punctual and delivery of lecture can be improved"
"English is my preferable subject. I wanted to study in English. Facilities are crowded, pressure of study, no proper place to seat. Teaching system, campus and almost everything I expect a proper environment where students can learn as well as have fun.The only thing which is good is time limitation."
sport and recreation are not available. thats sad. there should be a reliable sports field for students . the public has more functionality than the private
"To learn about English language and literature For lower tuition fee-Transport system  is not available 
-Wi-fi connection is not available in the Whole University 
-Less number of books in the Library 
-approved VC
-Huge collection of books in the library -very friendly
-qualified
-sincere 
I think you will give the messages which I share to our authority and play important rule to improve the quality of our university  as well as the others university of our country "
"I am from BBA Department. Because I've been a commerce student from the start and I know it better. Quality of education and campus. Very strict grading system, far from my place.The faculties and the campus are not enough. Strict grading system, too much students getting admitted. Apart from the unlimited intake of students, its fine. Above average"
Achievements Less teacher members and university campus .Education Campus environment Good and friendly faculties that can create an friendly environment of teaching. I am not satisfied with the teacher of my  department. They’re great but EEE department’s teacher members are less in number.
Needs to improve the education style.They should put more education pressure.
Extracurricular activities is held in our university and so I like it the most.
practical work provides detailed knowledge of theoretical work
Super quality of teaching  but exam paper checking is not good enough.
"Other the exams are extremely hard. The academic curriculum is not up to date. My expectations were simple, to learn advanced techniques and i guess i am not satisfied."
3 hours of lab is very long and is quite hectic so for this reason I do not like the system of my university
I would like to get admitted in CSE department of an university higher ranking and good faculties.
libary is giving a lot to us but we are not getting it. We need more practical experience and unfortunately these are missing in private universities.
Practical work is in interesting but different faculties evaluate in their own way. Some of the faculties in some section give marks without taking viva and some does not give marks accordingly.
good delivery of lectures in time and its is very helpful for the students
The extracurricular activities held in our university are very enjoyable and good. Students get huge opportunities
"CSE.BECAUSE EVERYONE IS DOING IT. The girl I liked studied here so I got admitted too. Unfortunately she got a boyfriend just after I joined brac. There's No campus. The Good faculties Amke it amazing. Expectation is to get good jobs, "
"too many examination, we are frustrated with this university. we also need value in the job market"
Content of the courses should be changed a bit. More of industry oriented feature like Linux and GitHub must be implemented. Proper detailing and advanced knowledge is required and is to be instilled in the students.The course material is good.
lab work is quite good in private universities.
in terms of lecture delivery and  punctuality our university is good but in terms of intraction it is very bad. There are some faculties that donot interact and do not listen to our problems which means that lack of co-operation exists.
good and ample number of extracurricular activities take place and we enjoy a lot here
Subjects taught are appropriate but much depth is required as syllabus includes only basics not the details.
It has been a wonderful experience in my university. And I am proud of it
I have never seen this type of examination in education.very GOOD pattern here in private universities
Very Tough Curicullum In Private Universities. Easier curicullum would be much appritiated.
The examination pattern is good. More of logic based and subjective questions to be asked which is based upon conceptual learning. Paper checking must be done in a more lucid manner because many doubts arise with the checking of OMR sheet.
I WAS A STUDENT OF A BOARDING SCHOOL. I STUDIED FOR 7 YEARS THERE RESIDING IN HOSTEL. NOW LIVING IN LPU IS SAME LIKE THAT. AND STILL MORE SAME AND PUNCTUALITY IS SHOWN HERE BY BOTH TEACHERS AND STUDENTS. AND ALSO BY THE STAFF. SECURITY IS ABOVE 90%(IN CASE OF STUDENT IS WELL MANURED) CLASSES ARE REGULAR. SPORTS DAILY. PARTICIPATION WELL. QUALITY BELOW AVERAGE
The faculties  are extraordinary so I am happy with my university
Tuition fee waiver is a crying need as the tuition fee is very high
They need to improve education qualities and make it more practical in a way that students can imply in their livesI'm not in a university. But from a medical student perspective I can say is it would be great to have a bigger campus and a bit more relaxing. 
It's too good for me as i study in my choosed subject in East West University. We have beautiful campus.
i am in CSE dept. I have a passion for doing research and development subject. we have a shitty campusI Extremely disappointed would not recommend. The course content is interesting but teaching styles and lectures let this down! The course is so organised and this shows through students grades
Its nice to tell that I have no complains about my university. And so far it is the best
"I am from CSE as I'm interested in problem solving and pattern. I choose my university on the basis of fees. As i'm an bangla medium student & an introvert person I'v struggled a lot in my 1st year, couldn't understand my lesson couldn't get enough resources. As a result got bad gpa . The best part is that you are free to choose your teacher and courses Practical knowledge.  Our faculties mostly focus on theory rather than practical implementation which is sad.  I was expecting to learn application of programming in real life which is not fullfilled. The faculties are quite friendly ."
They are good beacuse there is freedom of students. In public universities you are the slave of elders but here you can be fee. This is really what it means to study.
Our University provides good platform to interested students by providing quality education through creating a learning Environment. We need more faculties though
All practical work is good. Brac University is good at lab work.
Private universities are money grabbing hous.
The material provided is beneficial and provides much knowledge.
"Exam pattren is good, marks distribution is also good bt paper cheacking is very tight."
The tuition fee is very high and because of such fees it is very difficult for me to provide it.
"Computer Science. No campus, there is not enough place for students to sit and relax. Residential Semester. BRACU administration No expectations I just want to graduate and get out of hereNo all the faculties are good. Those who are good are too good and who are bad are way too bad"
"CGPA is not the only method of judgement for  reputation.  Too many students study here. No campus .At least some courses should be offered based on the current demands. No, the requirements are not met. Only the basics are taught . The university really should stop admitting so many students in one subject"
Universities are not bad. I only know about few though.
"Law Department BRAC University.
Felt it interesting. Achievements Personal and internal problems. Law Department of my University is one of the best in Chattogram. Students, i want the students of my University to grow up. They are really great."
ECE more or less focus on communication and resources. In Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology the campus is moderate. Political clashes here bigger than the education system over here.
Exam Paper checking can be improved .
All University examination pattern is good in Bangladesh. They have differences and that's interesting.
The lecturers we have are doing quite well but it would have been much more better if had few more senior lecturers. Senior lecturers can pravide much more in depth analysis on our courses.
"University Is About Knowledge & Library Is he Primary Source Of Knwoledge. Library is very important for any university.  Moreover, our clubs need more attention and facilities."
Universities in Bangladesh are more or less very bad. Everything related study have no proper combinations. In my perspective experiences over private university and public university in Bangladesh same and not suitable for intellectual students. 
"Awesome, peaceful and relaxing atmosphere is found which is a pleasure "
"interaction of some teacher was good but not all teacher.So, it is a problem."
I am from Brac business school. The best part is that our unversiity is a english medium univesity. Along with our studies we can learn english.
BBA is the best SUBJECT. LACK OF CAMPUS AND STUDENT OVERFLOW. QUALITY RULES AND REGULATIONS Are Moderate.  A NEW CAMPUS is required.
I aint that much interested to talk about my university. It sucks.
I choosed BRAC University CSE department because i was always passionate about making new things and what better option than making applications by yourself without investing a ton of money. Lack of space and still tons of students are being added every semester. Everything except for a handful of helpful faculties. I had not expectations from my university as i have already mentioned i was passionate about making new things. I loved working on my own but because of university pressure i can not continue what i was here for. When its about facilities there is not even the basic ones. Teacher quality is not up to the mark. I think it’s high time we stop this pressurizing culture.  
Really our library provides very good facilites for students and faculties but fine system was not good it was directly increased upto 10.This is not a good thing.
I study in Department of EEE. I was interested in the subject. It's known for a good . There's no space in our department . It is extremely crowded. There's no campus. The buildings are very risky with the lifts. Nothing comes to my mind . The grading system is very bad.  Insufficient Faculty is seen.Already the university is crowded but still they are taking more students every semester. The transportation system of the university should be improved 
The library facilities of my university is very satisfactory. it has an enriched collection of books.
